          <p>
            As new students, it's important to familiarize yourselves with the American healthcare system. The American
            healthcare system is characterized by a combination of public and private healthcare providers and insurance
            options. Unlike some other countries with government-funded universal healthcare, the U.S. system relies on
            a mix of employer-sponsored insurance, government programs, and individual market plans to ensure access to
            medical services. Understanding how health insurance works, finding suitable healthcare providers, and being
            aware of the costs associated with medical care are crucial aspects of navigating the American healthcare
            landscape. In this guide, we will provide you with an overview of the key components of the American
            healthcare system to help you make informed decisions about your health and well-being during your stay in
            the U.S.

          <h5>Physician Assistant (PA)</h5>
          <p class="ms-3">
            Physician Assistants (PAs) are healthcare professionals who work under the supervision of
            physicians/doctors.
            While their level of competence can vary, PAs receive extensive training and can provide high-quality
            medical
            care.
          </p>

          <h5>Registered Nurse (RN) vs Nurse Practitioner (NP)</h5>
          <p class="ms-3">
            RNs are licensed healthcare professionals who provide patient care, administer medications, monitor
            patients'
            conditions, and collaborate with other healthcare team members. They work under the direction of physicians
            and are often found in various healthcare settings, such as hospitals, clinics, and nursing homes. On the
            other hand, Nurse Practitioners (NPs) are advanced practice nurses who have completed additional education
            and
            training, enabling them to diagnose and treat common medical conditions, prescribe medications, and provide
            a
            higher level of patient care. NPs often have specialized areas of practice, such as family medicine,
            pediatrics, or women's health, and they may work independently or collaboratively with physicians, depending
            on state regulations. In essence, while RNs play a vital role in delivering direct patient care and support,
            NPs have an extended scope of practice that includes clinical assessment, diagnosis, and treatment planning.
          </p>

          <h5>Primary Care Physician (PCP)</h5>
          <p class="ms-3">
            A primary doctor, also known as a primary care physician (PCP) or general practitioner (GP), is the first
            point of contact for patients and provides basic medical care. To find a primary doctor, you can ask for
            recommendations, search online directories, and consider factors like credentials, compatibility, and
            insurance coverage. A primary doctor ensures comprehensive care, routine check-ups, preventive screenings,
            and
            access to specialized care if necessary.
          </p>

          <h5>Pre-authorization</h5>
          <p class="ms-3">
            Prior authorization is the approval process required by insurance companies before certain medical services,
            procedures, or medications can be covered. It involves submitting detailed information to the insurance
            company for review and determination of coverage. The purpose is to ensure that the recommended treatment is
            medically necessary and meets the insurer's criteria. Pre-authorization helps control healthcare costs and
            ensure appropriate utilization of services.
          </p>

          <h5>Referral</h5>
          <p class="ms-3">
            A formal recommendation provided by a primary care physician or a medical specialist to a patient,
            suggesting
            that they seek the expertise or services of another healthcare professional, specialist, or facility for
            further evaluation, diagnosis, or treatment of a specific medical condition. Doctor referrals are often
            based
            on the complexity of a patient's medical needs and may be necessary to ensure that the patient receives the
            most appropriate and specialized care. Referrals can help facilitate communication and collaboration between
            different healthcare providers, ensuring a comprehensive and coordinated approach to the patient's
            healthcare
            journey.
          </p>

          <h5>In-Network vs Out-of-Network</h5>
          <p class="ms-3">
            In health insurance, the terms "In-Network" and "Out-of-Network" refer to the network of healthcare
            providers
            and facilities that are associated with your insurance plan. Understanding the distinction between these
            terms
            is essential for managing your healthcare costs effectively:
          </p>

          <ol>
            <li>
              <strong>In-Network Coverage:</strong> In-Network refers to the group of healthcare providers, doctors,
              specialists,
              hospitals, clinics, and other medical facilities that have a contractual agreement with your insurance
              company. When you receive medical services from an In-Network provider, your insurance plan covers a
              significant portion of the costs, often through negotiated rates. In-Network care is usually more
              cost-effective, as insurance plans have pre-established agreements that help control expenses.
            </li>

            <li>
              <strong>Out-of-Network Coverage:</strong> Out-of-Network refers to healthcare providers and facilities
              that
              do not have a
              contract with your insurance company. If you choose to receive medical care from an Out-of-Network
              provider,
              your insurance coverage may be limited, and you'll likely be responsible for a larger portion of the
              costs.
              Insurance plans may still provide some level of coverage for Out-of-Network care, but the expenses can be
              considerably higher than for In-Network care.
            </li>
          </ol>


          <p class="ms-3">
            To maximize your health insurance benefits and minimize your out-of-pocket expenses, it's recommended to
            choose In-Network providers whenever possible. However, there may be situations where you need to seek care
            from an Out-of-Network provider, such as in emergencies or when specialized treatments are required. In such
            cases, it's important to check with your insurance company to understand the extent of coverage for
            Out-of-Network care and to budget for potential additional costs. Being aware of your insurance plan's
            network
            coverage helps you make informed decisions about your healthcare choices and avoid unexpected financial
            burdens.
          </p>

          <h5>Out-of-pocket costs (OOP) vs Deductible</h5>
          <p class="ms-3">
            Out-of-pocket costs and deductibles are key terms in health insurance that refer to the financial
            responsibilities individuals have when receiving medical care. Out-of-pocket costs encompass all expenses
            that
            a person pays directly for healthcare services, including deductibles, copayments, and coinsurance. A
            deductible, specifically, is the fixed amount a policyholder must pay out of their own pocket before their
            insurance starts covering a portion of the costs. For example, if a health plan has a $1,000 deductible, the
            insured individual must pay the first $1,000 of medical expenses before the insurance benefits begin to
            apply.
            It's important to understand both out-of-pocket costs and deductibles when selecting a health insurance
            plan,
            as they influence how much you'll pay for medical services and when your insurance coverage will take
            effect.

            It is highly advisable to students to go through comprehensive checkups before arriving in the US. Any
            general physician in Iran can order bloodwork and urinalysis to detect potential problems such as high blood
            sugar, high cholesterol, fatty liver problems, or low levels of vitamins and minerals, such as vitamin D,
            among others. Early intervention in such problems can make a significant difference in their treatment and
            your well-being.

            All visa applicants, regardless of age, are required to undergo a medical examination by one of the medical
            doctors or clinics on the following list. Only a physician accredited by the U.S. Embassy can perform this
            exam. Medical examination results from other physicians are not accepted.

            applicants should have their vaccination records available for the panel physician’s review at the time of
            the
            medical examination. Visa applicants should consult with their regular health care provider to obtain a copy
            of their immunization record, if available. If you do not have a vaccination record, the panel physician
            will
            work with you to determine which vaccinations you may need to meet the requirement. Certain waivers of the
            vaccination requirement are available upon the recommendation of the panel physician. Only the panel
            physician
            can determine which of the listed vaccinations are medically appropriate for you, given your age, medical
            history and current medical condition.

          <p>
            Health insurance is a critical consideration for students studying in the United States, serving as a
            safeguard against the often substantial costs associated with healthcare services in the country. The U.S.
            healthcare system operates differently from many other nations, with medical care generally being provided
            through a mix of private providers, hospitals, and clinics. Without proper health insurance coverage,
            students are exposed to potentially significant financial burdens in the event of illness or injury.
          </p>
          <p>
            The cost of healthcare in the U.S. can be notably higher compared to other countries, often due to factors
            such as administrative expenses, medical technology advancements, and the lack of a universal healthcare
            system. Routine doctor visits, prescription medications, emergency care, and hospital stays can accumulate
            into substantial expenses that might not be manageable without insurance. For instance, an overnight
            hospital stay for a minor procedure can easily amount to thousands of dollars, and even routine medical
            visits can carry substantial fees.
          </p>
          <p>
            Health insurance not only provides financial protection but also ensures access to timely and appropriate
            medical care. Having comprehensive coverage enables students to seek medical attention promptly, aiding in
            early diagnosis and preventive care. Additionally, many universities and educational institutions in the
            U.S. mandate health insurance for their students to ensure the well-being of the student population and
            minimize the risk of unexpected financial hardships.
          </p>
          <p>
            By enrolling in health insurance plans designed for students, such individuals gain peace of mind knowing
            that they are covered for medical needs, allowing them to focus on their studies and overall experience in
            the U.S. The investment in health insurance is a proactive step towards securing a healthier and more secure
            academic journey while mitigating the potentially overwhelming expenses that can arise from the U.S.
            healthcare system.

            PPO vs HMO:
          </h5>
          <p class="ms-3">
            Health Maintenance Organization (HMO) and Preferred Provider Organization (PPO) are two common types of
            health insurance plans, each with its own set of features and benefits. Understanding the differences
            between HMO and PPO health insurances can help individuals make informed decisions about their healthcare
            coverage.
          </p>
          <h6>
            HMO (Health Maintenance Organization):
          </h6>
          <p class="ms-3">
            HMO plans are designed to provide comprehensive and cost-effective healthcare coverage within a network of
            healthcare providers. Under an HMO, members are required to choose a primary care physician (PCP) who acts
            as a gatekeeper for all medical services. To see a specialist or receive certain medical treatments,
            patients generally need a referral from their PCP. Key features of HMO plans include:
          </p>
          <ol>
            <li>
              <strong>Network Restriction:</strong> HMO plans typically require members to use healthcare providers
              within the plan's
              network. Going out-of-network for care might not be covered except in emergencies.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Lower Costs:</strong> HMOs often have lower monthly premiums and out-of-pocket costs, making them
              attractive for
              individuals seeking more budget-friendly options.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Referrals:</strong> Members usually need referrals from their PCPs to see specialists or receive
              specialized
              treatments, ensuring coordinated and managed care.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Predictable Costs:</strong> HMOs offer predictable costs, making it easier for members to budget
              for healthcare
              expenses.
            </li>
          </ol>

          <h6>
            PPO (Preferred Provider Organization):
          </h6>
          <p class="ms-3">
            PPO plans offer more flexibility when it comes to choosing healthcare providers and receiving medical care.
            While PPOs have a network of preferred providers, members can also seek care outside the network, although
            at a higher cost. Key features of PPO plans include:
          </p>
          <ol>
            <li>
              <strong>Provider Choice:</strong> PPO plans allow members to see any healthcare provider, either within
              the network or
              out-of-network, without needing a referral.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Higher Costs for Out-of-Network Care:</strong> While PPOs offer flexibility, out-of-network care
              comes with
              higher costs, including higher deductibles, copayments, and coinsurance.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Higher Premiums:</strong> PPO plans tend to have higher monthly premiums compared to HMO plans,
              reflecting the
              increased flexibility and provider choice.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Less Coordination:</strong> PPO plans generally offer less coordinated care compared to HMOs, as
              there is no
              requirement for referrals or coordination through a primary care physician.
            </li>
          </ol>
          <p class="ms-3">
            When choosing between HMO and PPO health insurance plans, individuals should consider their healthcare
            needs, budget, and preferences. If having a broader choice of healthcare providers is important and cost
            considerations are manageable, a PPO plan might be a suitable choice. On the other hand, if lower costs and
            a more managed approach to care coordination are priorities, an HMO plan could be more appropriate. It's
            important to carefully review the details of each plan and assess how well they align with your health and
            financial needs.

          Public, Private, Employer-Provided
        </h5>
          <p class="ms-3">
            Health insurance in the United States comes in various forms, with three primary categories: Public,
            Private, and Employer-Provided health insurance. Each type offers distinct benefits and considerations,
            catering to different circumstances and preferences.
          </p>
          <h6>
            Public Health Insurance:
          </h6>
          <p class="ms-3">
            Public health insurance is provided by government programs and is aimed at offering coverage to specific
            groups of individuals, particularly those with lower income or certain eligibility criteria. Key examples of
            public health insurance include:
          </p>
          <ol>
            <li>
              <strong>Medicaid:</strong> A state and federally funded program that provides health coverage to eligible
              low-income
              individuals and families, pregnant women, children, and people with disabilities.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Medicare:</strong> A federal program that primarily serves seniors aged 65 and older, and certain
              younger
              individuals with disabilities. It consists of Part A (hospital insurance) and Part B (medical insurance),
              often supplemented by Part D (prescription drug coverage) and Medigap plans.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>CHIP (Children's Health Insurance Program):</strong> A state and federally funded program that
              provides health
              coverage to eligible children in low-income families.
            </li>
          </ol>

          <h6>
            Private Health Insurance:
          </h6>
          <p class="ms-3">
            Private health insurance is offered by private insurance companies and provides coverage to individuals,
            families, and groups. It encompasses various plans tailored to different needs, including:
          </p>
          <ol>
            <li>
              <strong>Individual and Family Plans:</strong> These plans are purchased directly by individuals or
              families, providing
              coverage for medical services, prescription drugs, and other healthcare needs.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Short-Term Health Plans:</strong> These plans offer temporary coverage for individuals in
              transition, such as
              those between jobs or waiting for employer coverage to begin.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Catastrophic Plans:</strong> These plans are designed for young, healthy individuals and offer
              coverage for
              essential health benefits after a high deductible has been met.
            </li>
          </ol>
          <p class="ms-3">
            Private health insurance offers a wide range of options to suit varying budgets, health needs, and
            preferences. While premiums and coverage levels can vary, private plans generally provide more flexibility
            in terms of choosing healthcare providers and services.
          </p>
          <h6>
            Employer-Provided Health Insurance:
          </h6>
          <p class="ms-3">
            Employer-provided health insurance is a common benefit offered by employers to their employees. It's a form
            of group health insurance that helps employees access medical care and coverage through their workplace. Key
            features of employer-provided health insurance include:
          </p>
          <ol>
            <li>
              <strong>Group Coverage:</strong> These plans provide coverage for a group of employees and sometimes their
              dependents,
              leading to potential cost savings due to economies of scale.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Employer Subsidy:</strong> Employers often contribute a portion of the insurance premium, reducing
              the financial
              burden on employees.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Cafeteria Plans:</strong> Some employers offer a choice of health plans, allowing employees to
              select the plan
              that best meets their individual needs.
            </li>
          </ol>
          <p class="ms-3">
            Employer-provided health insurance is an important employee benefit that contributes to the overall
            well-being and job satisfaction of workers. It simplifies the process of obtaining health coverage by
            offering a predefined set of options.
          </p>
          <p class="ms-3">
            Choosing the right type of health insurance depends on individual circumstances, including income, health
            needs, family size, and personal preferences. It's essential to carefully assess the available options and
            select the coverage that best aligns with your healthcare requirements and financial situation.

            Coverage Categories
          </h5>
          <p class="ms-3">
            Health insurance coverage is often categorized into different tiers, each represented by metals such as
            Bronze, Silver, Gold, and Platinum. These categories help individuals compare and choose insurance plans
            based on their healthcare needs and budget.
          </p>
          <ol>
            <li>
              <strong>Bronze Plans:</strong> Bronze plans typically have the lowest monthly premiums but come with
              higher
              out-of-pocket costs when you need medical care. They are suited for individuals who don't anticipate
              frequent medical visits or need minimal coverage.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Silver Plans:</strong> Silver plans strike a balance between premiums and out-of-pocket costs.
              They are designed
              to be moderate in terms of monthly payments and cost-sharing. Silver plans may also offer cost-sharing
              reductions for lower-income individuals and families.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Gold Plans:</strong> Gold plans have higher monthly premiums than Bronze or Silver plans, but they
              come with
              lower out-of-pocket costs when you use medical services. These plans are ideal for those who anticipate
              needing more medical care and are willing to pay higher premiums for reduced cost-sharing.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Platinum Plans:</strong> Platinum plans have the highest monthly premiums but offer the lowest
              out-of-pocket
              costs when you receive medical treatment. These plans are suitable for individuals who expect frequent
              medical visits, have ongoing medical conditions, or prefer the peace of mind of comprehensive coverage.
            </li>
          </ol>
          <p class="ms-3">
            It's important to consider your healthcare needs, budget, and the balance between monthly premiums and
            potential out-of-pocket expenses when selecting a coverage category. Some individuals may opt for a higher
            premium to minimize unexpected costs, while others may choose a lower premium if they are generally healthy
            and don't foresee many medical expenses. Comparing plans within each category and evaluating their coverage
            details will help you make an informed decision that aligns with your healthcare requirements.

            Types of health insurance coverages you need
          </h5>
          <p class="ms-3">
            Health insurance coverage can extend beyond medical services to include specialized areas like vision and
            dental care, offering comprehensive protection for various aspects of your well-being. Here's an overview of
            these different types of health insurance:
          </p>
          <ol>
            <li>
              <strong>Medical Insurance:</strong> Medical insurance, often referred to as health insurance, covers a
              range of medical
              services, treatments, and procedures. This includes doctor visits, hospital stays, prescription
              medications, preventive care, and specialist consultations. Medical insurance is crucial for managing
              unexpected medical expenses and ensuring access to quality healthcare when needed. It helps individuals
              and families receive necessary medical treatments without incurring exorbitant costs.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Vision Insurance:</strong> Vision insurance is designed to address eye care needs. It covers eye
              exams,
              prescription eyeglasses, contact lenses, and sometimes even vision correction procedures like LASIK.
              Regular eye exams are essential for maintaining good vision health and detecting early signs of
              eye-related issues. Vision insurance helps reduce the financial burden of routine eye care and eyewear
              expenses, making it easier for individuals to prioritize their visual health.

              <strong>Dental Insurance:</strong> Dental insurance focuses on oral health maintenance and treatment. It
              covers
              preventive services like routine dental check-ups, cleanings, and X-rays, as well as restorative
              treatments such as fillings, root canals, and crowns. Some plans may also offer coverage for orthodontic
              work, like braces or Invisalign. Dental insurance encourages individuals to maintain regular dental care,
              preventing potential oral health problems and ensuring healthy teeth and gums.

          </ol>
          <p class="ms-3">
            While medical insurance is generally considered essential for overall healthcare coverage, vision and dental
            insurance are optional but valuable additions that address specific health needs. Deciding whether to invest
            in vision and dental coverage depends on your individual requirements, financial situation, and the level of
            care you anticipate needing in these areas. By carefully evaluating your needs and the coverage provided by
            each type of insurance, you can make informed decisions that contribute to your overall well-being.

              <h2 class="h4">Insurance Requirements for International Students</h2>
            </div>
          </div>

          <p>
            The Department of State insurance requirements for international students play a crucial role in ensuring
            the well-being and safety of individuals who come to study in the United States. These requirements are
            designed to provide a comprehensive and consistent level of health coverage to international students,
            safeguarding them against the potential financial burdens of healthcare expenses in a foreign country.

          </p>
          <p>
            The Department of State mandates that J-1 exchange visitors, including international students, must maintain
            health insurance that meets specific criteria outlined in the regulations. These requirements aim to ensure
            that students have access to adequate medical care and that they are not burdened by exorbitant medical
            costs during their stay in the U.S. The specifics of the required coverage may vary, but typically include
            provisions for:

          </p>
          <ol>
            <li>
              <strong>Minimum Medical Coverage:</strong> The insurance plan should provide a minimum level of coverage
              for medical expenses, including hospitalization, surgery, doctor visits, and prescription medications.

            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Emergency Medical Evacuation:</strong> The plan should cover the costs of emergency medical
              evacuation to the student's home country or the nearest medical facility capable of providing appropriate
              care.

            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Repatriation of Remains:</strong> The insurance should cover the expenses associated with
              returning the student's remains to their home country in the unfortunate event of their passing.

            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Deductibles and Copayments:</strong> The plan should have reasonable deductibles and copayments to
              ensure that students are not burdened with excessive out-of-pocket costs.

            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Pre-existing Conditions:</strong> The plan may not exclude coverage for pre-existing conditions,
              ensuring that students with existing health conditions are still able to access necessary medical care.

            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Medical Benefits per Accident or Illness:</strong> The plan should specify the maximum amount of
              coverage provided per accident or illness, helping students understand the extent of their benefits.

            </li>
          </ol>

          <p>
            Many universities and educational institutions offer health insurance plans specifically tailored for F-1
            students that meet the required criteria. These plans take into account the unique healthcare needs of
            international students and provide coverage for a range of medical services. It's important to carefully
            review the details of the insurance plan offered by your institution, ensuring that it aligns with the
            Department of State's requirements and adequately addresses your health needs.

          </p>

          <h5>Dependent Insurance Coverage</h5>

          <p class="ms-3">
            The university does not provide insurance coverage for dependents, so you will need to purchase it yourself.
            You can explore minimum coverage plans on the Covered California website at https://www.coveredca.com/. One
            option to consider is Anthem Blue Cross, which offers insurance plans in California.

          </p>
          <p class="ms-3">
            The cost of minimum coverage varies and is influenced by factors such as age, gender, and personal
            circumstances. In 2021, the approximate cost was around $180, but it's important to obtain a specific quote
            based on your individual situation.

          </p>
          <p class="ms-3">
            It's crucial to note that as an international student on a visa, you are not eligible for discounts intended
            for low-income individuals, even if the websites offering insurance plans may mistakenly allow you to
            proceed with the application. However, there is a risk that the application may be canceled at some point,
            potentially leading to consequences later on. Therefore, it's important to ensure that you comply with the
            eligibility requirements and regulations when purchasing insurance.

          </h5>
          <p class="ms-3">
            Primary care physicians (PCPs) play a pivotal role in healthcare as the first point of contact for patients
            seeking medical assistance. These medical professionals, often specializing in family medicine, internal
            medicine, or pediatrics, offer comprehensive and preventive care to individuals of all ages. Primary care
            physicians are trained to diagnose and treat a wide range of common illnesses and health concerns, provide
            vaccinations, perform routine check-ups, and offer guidance on maintaining a healthy lifestyle. They also
            serve as coordinators of a patient's healthcare journey, referring them to specialists when necessary and
            ensuring continuity of care. Developing a long-term relationship with a primary care physician fosters
            personalized and holistic healthcare, promoting overall well-being and early detection of potential health
            issues.
          </p>
          <h5>
            Urgent Care
          </h5>
          <p class="ms-3">
            Urgent care is immediate medical service provided for non-life-threatening illnesses or injuries.
          </p>
          <div class="alert alert-primary">
            For severe or life-threatening conditions, it is best to go directly to the emergency room or call
            emergency services such as 911.
          </div>
          <p class="ms-3">
            <strong>Hours:</strong> Most urgent care centers have extended hours, including evenings and weekends,
            making them an
            accessible alternative when regular doctor's offices are closed. It's always a good idea to check the
            specific operating hours of an urgent care center to ensure they align with your needs.
          </p>
          <p class="ms-3">
            <strong>Services:</strong> These centers offer timely treatment for a range of minor to moderate health
            issues, such as
            sprains, minor fractures, cuts requiring stitches, flu symptoms, and infections.
          </p>
          <p class="ms-3">
            <strong>Cost:</strong> Urgent care visits generally fall in between the cost of a regular doctor's visit and
            an emergency
            room visit. While they are typically less expensive than emergency room visits, they may be more expensive
            than a standard appointment with your primary care doctor. It is important to check your health insurance
            coverage to determine if urgent care visits are included and to understand any associated costs such as
            copayments or deductibles.
          </p>
          <p class="ms-3">
            <strong>No Appointment Needed:</strong> Urgent care centers typically do not require appointments and have
            shorter wait times
            than emergency rooms.
          </p>
          <h5>
            Emergency Department (ER / ED)
          </h5>
          <p class="ms-3">
            Emergency rooms are 24/7 hospital departments equipped to handle severe and life-threatening conditions.
            They provide immediate medical care and play a critical role in diagnosing and treating urgent emergencies.
          </p>
          <div class="alert alert-primary">
            Usually Emergency rooms are located at or near hospitals.
          </div>
          <p class="ms-3">
            Choose the ER before needing its services: The quality of care in an emergency room can highly vary from a
            location to another. It is highly advisable that you find a reliable emergency room that is as close to
            where you live and work as possible before you need the services of the emergency room. This may involve
            researching online resources and patient reviews, so that when an emergency situation occurs, you know where
            to go and what to expect.
          </p>
          <p class="ms-3">
            ER always admits you: if you go to an ER, you will always be admitted, even if your condition does not seem
            to be life threatening. In case no other medical options seem to be available, going to an ER is always
            better than neglecting the issue, as ordinary humans do not have the expertise to assess the severity of
            their conditions.
          </p>
          <p class="ms-3">
            <strong>When to Go:</strong> You need to seek immediate medical attention at the emergency room (ER) for
            conditions such as
            intense chest pain, difficulty breathing, sudden or severe pain, uncontrollable bleeding, severe burns,
            suspected poisoning, or if you suspect a potentially serious condition such as a stroke or heart attack. In
            such extreme cases, the best course of action may be calling 911 instead of driving one’s self or others to
            the hospital, as time might be extremely important in saving the life of the patient.
          </p>
          <p class="ms-3">
            <strong>Cost:</strong> Emergency room (ER) care is typically the most expensive type of care provided
            outside of regular
            medical appointments. It is best to utilize it for serious, life-threatening conditions that require
            immediate attention.
          </p>
          <p class="ms-3">
            <strong>Wait Times:</strong> In the emergency room (ER), patients are prioritized according to the severity
            of their
            condition rather than the order of arrival. Consequently, individuals with less severe conditions may
            experience longer wait times due to the prioritization of more urgent cases.
          </p>
          <p class="ms-3">
            <strong>Insurance:</strong> It is essential to review the specific details regarding coverage for emergency
            room (ER) visits.
            Generally, ER visits involve a co-payment, which is a fixed amount that you are required to pay at the time
            of service. Additionally, it's important to note that if you receive treatment from healthcare providers who
            are considered out-of-network, there may be additional costs involved.
          </p>
          <div class="alert alert-primary">
            Consider referring to your insurance policy documents or contacting your insurance provider directly.
          </div>
          <p class="ms-3">
            <strong>Access to Emergency Room Care without Financial Means</strong>:
            The hospital is required to treat you regardless of insurance status. Under the Emergency Medical Treatment
            and Labor Act (EMTALA), anyone who goes to the ER must be stabilized and treated, even if they are uninsured
            and it's not clear how they will pay for treatment.
          </p>
          <h5>
            Emergency Medical Services (911)
          </h5>
          <p class="ms-3">
            Ambulances provide transportation to the hospital and allow emergency medical technicians (EMTs) to provide
            initial treatment on the way. However, calling an ambulance is not always the only option for reaching the
            hospital. It's important to consider other means of transportation when appropriate. If uncertain, it's best
            to call 911. In non-life-threatening situations, alternative transportation options may be available.
            Ambulances are typically necessary for life-threatening cases. Factors like location and cost should be
            considered. Emergency physicians will be ready to provide care regardless of your mode of arrival.

            How to make a doctor’s appointment?
          </h5>
          <p>
            There are different ways to book an appointment with a medical facility:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              <strong>Walk-in or Same-Day Appointments:</strong> For urgent or immediate medical needs, you may have the
              option to visit a healthcare facility and request a walk-in or same-day appointment. These appointments
              are usually available on a first-come, first-served basis.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Phone Call:</strong> You can call the healthcare provider's office directly to schedule an
              appointment. The receptionist or appointment scheduler will assist you in finding a suitable date and
              time.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Online Booking:</strong> Many healthcare providers offer online platforms or patient portals where
              you can schedule appointments. These platforms allow you to view available time slots and book an
              appointment at your convenience.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Mobile Apps:</strong> Some healthcare providers have mobile apps that allow you to schedule
              appointments directly from your smartphone or tablet. These apps often provide additional features like
              appointment reminders and access to medical records.
            </li>
          </ul>
          <h5>
            Referrals
          </h5>
          <p>
            Also known as physician referrals, are recommendations made by a primary care doctor or specialist for a
            patient to see another healthcare provider or specialist. Referrals are typically made when a patient's
            condition requires specialized care beyond the expertise of the referring doctor. These referrals may be
            required by insurance companies for coverage of specialist visits or certain medical procedures. The
            referring doctor ensures that the specialist receives relevant medical information, facilitating ongoing
            care coordination and collaboration among healthcare professionals to address the patient's unique
            healthcare needs.
          </p>
          <p>
            The referral system involves coordination between the primary care doctor, specialist, and the patient's
            insurance provider. When specialized care is needed, the primary care doctor determines if a referral is
            necessary and provides a recommendation. The patient then contacts their insurance provider to understand
            referral requirements and guidelines, such as pre-authorization or choosing from a network of specialists.
            After approval, the primary care doctor shares relevant medical information with the specialist for ongoing
            collaboration. It's important for patients to be aware of their insurance plan's referral policies to ensure
            proper steps are followed and maximize insurance coverage for specialist care.
          </p>
          <h5>
            Telemedicine
          </h5>
          <p>
            Telemedicine is a way of receiving healthcare services remotely through technology. It lets you talk to
            doctors and get medical advice using video calls, phone calls, or online messaging. It's convenient, helps
            you access healthcare easily, and allows for timely medical help without going to the doctor's office.

            Taking care of your mental health is essential for your overall well-being. If you’re facing challenges with
            your mental health, it is important to take proactive steps. Reach out to trusted individuals in your life,
            such as friends or family, who can provide support and guidance. Seek professional help from a mental health
            professional who can accurately diagnose your condition and recommend appropriate treatment options.
            Practice self-care by prioritizing activities that promote well-being, such as regular exercise, sufficient
            sleep, and engaging in enjoyable hobbies. Find healthy ways to manage stress and establish boundaries to
            effectively handle challenging situations. Connect with others through community events or support groups to
            foster a sense of belonging and understanding. Avoid self-medication and explore healthier coping
            strategies. Educate yourself about mental health conditions and available treatment options to empower
            yourself in your recovery journey. Remember to be patient and compassionate towards yourself, as healing
            takes time. In times of crisis or if you have thoughts of self-harm, seek immediate help from a mental
            health professional or call emergency services.

          <p>
            University counseling services refer to mental health support and counseling resources available
            specifically for students enrolled in universities or colleges. These services are typically provided by
            trained professionals, such as counselors or psychologists, who specialize in addressing the unique
            challenges and concerns faced by students.
          </p>

          <p>
            University counseling services aim to support students' mental well-being and help them navigate academic,
            personal, and emotional difficulties that may arise during their time at the university. These services may
            include:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>Individual counseling with therapists</li>

            <li>Individual counseling with psychiatrists</li>

            <li>Group therapy</li>

            <li>Crisis intervention</li>

            <li>Educational workshops</li>

          </ul>
          <p>
            These services are often free or available at a reduced cost for enrolled students.

            Finding mental health care for students outside the university is a significant consideration for those
            seeking professional support beyond the resources provided on campus. Prioritizing mental health is
            essential for overall well-being, and knowing how to access care off-campus can be valuable in ensuring a

              <strong>Identify Your Needs</strong>
              <p>
                Before beginning your search, reflect on your specific needs and preferences. Consider the type of
                therapy
                or
                treatment you're seeking, whether it's individual therapy, group therapy, counseling, medication
                management,
                or a specific approach like cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT) or mindfulness-based therapy.

              <strong>Types of Providers</strong>
              <p>
                There are various types of mental health providers, including psychologists, psychiatrists, therapists,
                counselors, social workers, and psychiatric nurse practitioners. Understand the roles, qualifications,
                and
                specialties of each to find the provider that best matches your needs.
              </p>
            </li>

            <li>
              <strong>Ask for Recommendations</strong>
              <p>
                Reach out to friends, family members, healthcare professionals, or trusted individuals who may have
                experience
                with mental health providers. Personal recommendations can provide valuable insights and help you narrow
                down
                your options.
              </p>
            </li>

            <li>
              <strong>Online Searches and Directories</strong>
              <p>
                Use online search engines, therapist directories, and mental health organization websites to find
                providers in
                your area. Many directories allow you to filter by location, specialties, treatment approaches, and
                insurance
                accepted.
              </p>
            </li>

            <li>
              <strong>Verify Credentials</strong>
              <p>
                Ensure that the providers you're considering are licensed and credentialed in your state. You can
                usually
                verify licenses through state licensing boards or professional organizations.
              </p>
            </li>

            <li>
              <strong>Read Reviews and Websites</strong>
              <p>
                Read online reviews and visit the websites of potential providers to learn more about their backgrounds,
                treatment philosophies, specialties, and approach to therapy. This can help you get a sense of their
                style
                and
                whether it aligns with your preferences.
              </p>
            </li>

            <li>
              <strong>Contact Potential Providers</strong>
              <p>
                Reach out to the providers you're interested in to ask questions, discuss your needs, and inquire about
                their
                availability. This initial conversation can give you a sense of their communication style and whether
                you
                feel
                comfortable with them.
              </p>
            </li>

            <li>
              <strong>Consider Compatibility</strong>
              <p>
                Therapeutic fit is essential for effective treatment. Consider factors like personality, communication
                style,
                cultural sensitivity, and your overall comfort level when interacting with the provider.
              </p>
            </li>

            <li>
              <strong>Insurance and Cost</strong>
              <p>
                If you have health insurance, check whether the provider is in-network or out-of-network. Inquire about
                fees,
                payment options, sliding scale rates, and whether they accept insurance.
              </p>
            </li>

            <li>
              <strong>Consultation or Initial Session</strong>
              <p>
                Many providers offer an initial consultation or session where you can discuss your concerns, treatment
                goals, and ask questions. Use this opportunity to assess whether you feel a connection and trust with
                the
                provider.
              </p>
            </li>
          </ol>


          <p class="ms-3">
            Finding the right mental health provider is a collaborative process that requires careful consideration.
            Remember that seeking support is a positive step toward better mental health, and finding a provider who
            understands and supports your journey can make a significant difference in your well-being.

          <h5>Psychologist vs Psychiatrist vs Therapist</h5>

          <p class="ms-3">
            While all three professionals play vital roles in addressing mental health concerns, their training,
            approaches, and areas of expertise vary:
          </p>
          <p class="ms-3">
            <strong>Psychologist:</strong> A psychologist is a mental health professional who specializes in the study
            of human behavior,
            emotions, and cognitive processes. Psychologists hold doctoral degrees (Ph.D. or Psy.D.) and are trained to
            diagnose and treat a wide range of mental health issues. They use various therapeutic approaches, such as
            cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT), psychoanalysis, and humanistic therapy, to help clients manage their
            emotions, thoughts, and behaviors. Psychologists often provide talk therapy and work collaboratively with
            clients to develop coping strategies and promote psychological well-being.
          </p>
          <p class="ms-3">
            <strong>Psychiatrist:</strong> A psychiatrist is a medical doctor (M.D. or D.O.) who specializes in the
            diagnosis, treatment,
            and management of mental health disorders. Psychiatrists can prescribe medication and offer a combination of
            pharmacological interventions and psychotherapy to address mental health issues. Their training includes
            medical school, followed by specialized training in psychiatry. While they focus on biological factors
            influencing mental health, they also consider psychological and environmental factors in their assessments
            and treatment plans.
          </p>
          <p class="ms-3">
            <strong>Therapist:</strong> The term "therapist" is a broad category that encompasses various mental health
            professionals who
            provide counseling and support. Therapists can include psychologists, psychiatrists, licensed clinical
            social workers (LCSWs), licensed professional counselors (LPCs), marriage and family therapists (MFTs), and
            more. Therapists often offer talk therapy, helping clients address emotional and psychological challenges.
            They may specialize in specific therapeutic approaches or work with specific populations, such as couples,
            families, or individuals.
          </p>
          <p class="ms-3">
            When seeking mental health support, it's important to consider your individual needs and preferences.
            Choosing the right mental health professional depends on the severity of your concerns, the type of
            treatment you're comfortable with, and any specific requirements you have. Consulting with a primary care
            physician or university counseling center can also provide guidance on which professional might be the best
            fit for your situation.
          </p>
          <h5>Insurance and Expenses</h5>

          <p class="ms-3">
            If using Insurance, check your policy to see if mental health services are covered and what providers are
            in-network. Contact your insurance company to understand the specific details of your coverage, such as
            copayments, deductibles, and any pre-authorization requirements. You can also pay out of pocket, meaning no
            coverage by your insurance which usually is more expensive.

            It is advisable to have a comprehensive dental screening before arriving, to at least know what type of
            dental problems you have and what the treatment options are.
          <p>
            Many students find it more cost-effective to complete their dental work before arriving in the US. Even the
            best dentists in Iran may charge orders of magnitude less than the average cost of dental procedures in
            Iran.
          </p>
          <p>
            Note that the standard of dental care in the US is very high, and dentists use cutting edge technology to
            provide dental care. The answer to the question whether one wants to use the expensive dental care in the US
            or complete the procedures in another country (e.g., Iran) involves a trade-off. This does not mean the
            quality of all dental procedures outside the US are less than the US. But this might be true for your
            specific dental procedure.

            If you are funded, your funding package probably include dental insurance and you are automatically enrolled
            in dental insurance benefits. To be formally insured, you need to activate your insurance plan for the first
            time. If you are not funded by university, you need to get an insurance plan individually or through your
            workplace or family (if applicable). You might also be eligible as a low-income individual and get services
            and benefits for lower prices. You need to further check if applying to these services has any effect on
            your prospective immigration-related applications.

          <p>
            Most universities have schools of dentistry that provide low cost dental care to students and the public.
            Note that those procedures are usually performed by students, under close supervision of the faculty.
          </p>
          <p>
            The faculty of dental schools may practice dentistry on-campus. Usually dental insurances provided by
            universities provide incentives for those who use the insurance to access the services of the faculty of
            their dental schools.
          </p>
          <p>
            Using online directories, asking for recommendations from friends or family, or checking with your insurance
            provider for a list of in-network dentists. Consider factors such as location, office hours, and
            specialization when choosing a dentist.

          <p>
            Examples of emergency procedures are procedures that are done after trauma to a tooth or emergency root
            canals and treatments of abscesses. In case of trauma that displaces a tooth, the best course of action
            might be seeing a dentist, as the tooth might still be viable and be put back by the dentist, and time is
            essential in reattaching the tooth.
          </p>
          <p>
            Dentists usually recommend taking over the counter (OTC) pain medications to alleviate dental pain in
            non-emergency cases, until a dentist can be seen in regular business hours. Examples of such medications are
            Ibuprofen and Acetaminophen.
          </p>

            Emergency Dental Appointments
          </h5>

          <p class="ms-3">
            Emergency dentists are very expensive and can charge more than three times the price of a regular dental
            procedure out of regular business hours. To find an emergency dentist close to you, search “emergency
            dentist near me” using a search engine and call the office of the dentist to make sure they are available.

            Vision care encompasses a range of services aimed at preserving and enhancing visual health. Regular eye
            exams are a fundamental aspect of vision care, as they can identify refractive errors (such as
            nearsightedness, farsightedness, and astigmatism), as well as detect conditions like glaucoma, cataracts,
            and retinal issues. Eye care professionals, including optometrists and ophthalmologists, provide services
            such as:
          </p>
          <p>
            <strong>Comprehensive Eye Exams:</strong> Routine eye exams evaluate visual acuity, assess eye health, and
            detect any potential problems.
          </p>
          <p>
            <strong>Prescription Eyewear:</strong> Corrective eyeglasses and contact lenses are prescribed based on
            individual visual needs.
          </p>
          <p>
            <strong>Screening for Eye Diseases:</strong> Regular eye exams help detect and manage eye conditions and
            diseases that might not exhibit noticeable symptoms in their early stages.
          </p>
          <p>
            <strong>Specialized Care:</strong> Eye care professionals can provide specialized services, such as fitting
            contact lenses, managing eye allergies, and offering vision therapy for certain visual issues.

          <h5>Optometrist</h5>
          <p class="ms-3">
            An optometrist is a primary eye care provider who specializes in performing eye exams, diagnosing vision
            problems, and prescribing corrective eyewear such as eyeglasses and contact lenses. Optometrists have earned
            a Doctor of Optometry (O.D.) degree after completing a four-year professional program following their
            undergraduate studies. Key responsibilities of optometrists include:
          </p>

          <p class="ms-3">
            <strong>Eye Exams:</strong> Optometrists conduct comprehensive eye exams to assess visual acuity, determine
            refractive errors, and detect early signs of eye diseases and conditions.
          </p>
          <p class="ms-3">
            <strong>Prescription Eyewear:</strong> Optometrists prescribe eyeglasses and contact lenses to correct
            vision problems such as myopia, hyperopia, and astigmatism.
          </p>
          <p class="ms-3">
            <strong>Detection of Eye Diseases:</strong> Optometrists can identify and diagnose common eye conditions
            like glaucoma, cataracts, dry eye, and conjunctivitis.
          </p>
          <p class="ms-3">
            <strong>Preventive Care:</strong> Optometrists emphasize preventive eye care and provide guidance on
            maintaining optimal eye health through proper nutrition and eye protection.
          </p>
          <h5>Ophthalmologist</h5>
          <p class="ms-3">
            An ophthalmologist is a medical doctor (M.D. or D.O.) who specializes in comprehensive eye care, including
            medical and surgical interventions for various eye conditions. Ophthalmologists undergo extensive medical
            training, including medical school and a residency program focused on ophthalmology. They have a broader
            scope of practice compared to optometrists, including:
          </p>

          <p class="ms-3">
            <strong>Medical Diagnoses and Treatments:</strong> Ophthalmologists diagnose and treat a wide range of eye
            conditions, including diseases that affect both vision and overall eye health.
          </p>
          <p class="ms-3">
            <strong>Surgical Interventions:</strong> Ophthalmologists perform surgical procedures, such as cataract
            surgery, LASIK, corneal transplants, and retinal surgeries.
          </p>
          <p class="ms-3">
            <strong>Complex Eye Care:</strong> Ophthalmologists manage advanced conditions like retinal detachment,
            macular degeneration, diabetic retinopathy, and glaucoma.
          </p>
          <p class="ms-3">
            <strong>Emergency Eye Care:</strong> Ophthalmologists are equipped to handle eye emergencies and trauma,
            offering timely intervention to prevent vision loss.
          </p>
          <h5>Choosing Between Optometrists and Ophthalmologists</h5>
          <p class="ms-3">
            Whether you choose to see an optometrist or an ophthalmologist depends on your specific eye care needs. If
            you primarily require routine eye exams, vision correction, and basic treatment for common eye conditions,
            an optometrist may be suitable. However, if you have complex eye conditions, need surgical interventions, or
            require specialized medical care, consulting an ophthalmologist is recommended. If you're unsure which
            provider is best for your situation, consulting with your primary care physician or seeking recommendations
            from trusted sources can help guide your decision.

            Vision insurance is a type of insurance coverage that helps individuals manage the costs associated with eye
            care services and eyewear. It's typically offered as a separate plan or as an add-on to comprehensive health
            insurance. Vision insurance plans generally cover a variety of services and products, which may include:
          </p>
          <p>
            <strong>Eye Exams:</strong> Coverage for routine eye exams, which are often recommended annually or
            biennially.
          </p>
          <p>
            <strong>Eyeglasses:</strong> Benefits for frames and lenses, including single vision, bifocal, and
            progressive lenses.
          </p>
          <p>
            <strong>Contact Lenses:</strong> Coverage for contact lens exams, fitting, and the purchase of contact
            lenses.
          </p>
          <p>
            <strong>Discounts:</strong> Some vision insurance plans offer discounts on additional eyewear, such as
            prescription sunglasses.
          </p>
          <p>
            <strong>Specialty Services:</strong> Depending on the plan, coverage might extend to services like vision
            therapy or treatment for specific eye conditions.
          </p>
          <p>
            It's important to note that vision insurance plans vary in terms of coverage limits, network providers, and
            out-of-pocket costs. When considering vision insurance, it's advisable to review the details of the plan to
            understand what services and products are covered, the providers within the network, and any copayments or
            deductibles.

            Retail Pharmacies
          </h5>
          <p class="ms-3">
            Retail pharmacies are commonly found within drugstore chains, supermarkets, and big-box retailers. They
            offer a wide range of medications, health and wellness products, personal care items, and over-the-counter
            medicines. Retail pharmacies often have licensed pharmacists on staff who can provide medication counseling,
            answer questions about prescriptions, and offer guidance on appropriate use of medications.

          </p>
          <h5>
            Independent Pharmacies
          </h5>
          <p class="ms-3">
            Independent pharmacies are locally owned and operated businesses that provide personalized service and often
            cater to the specific needs of their communities. These pharmacies may offer a more intimate and familiar
            atmosphere, and pharmacists can establish closer relationships with customers, providing tailored advice and
            recommendations.

          </p>
          <h5>
            Hospital Pharmacies
          </h5>
          <p class="ms-3">
            Hospital pharmacies operate within medical facilities and are responsible for dispensing medications
            prescribed to patients during their hospital stays. Hospital pharmacists work closely with healthcare teams
            to ensure that patients receive the right medications and dosages according to their treatment plans.

          </p>
          <h5>

          <p class="ms-3">
            Mail-order and online pharmacies provide the convenience of having medications delivered directly to
            individuals' homes. This option is especially beneficial for individuals with chronic conditions who require
            regular medication refills. However, it's important to choose reputable online pharmacies that require valid
            prescriptions and adhere to safety regulations.

          </p>
          <h5>
            Specialty Pharmacies
          </h5>
          <p class="ms-3">
            Specialty pharmacies focus on providing medications for complex and specialized medical conditions such as
            cancer, HIV, and autoimmune disorders. These pharmacies often offer specialized services, patient education,
            and support to manage the unique challenges of these conditions.

            Prescription medications, often referred to as "Rx medications," are medications that can only be obtained
            with a valid prescription from a licensed healthcare professional, such as a physician, nurse practitioner,
            or dentist. These medications are typically used to treat specific medical conditions, manage symptoms, and
            improve overall health. Prescription medications are regulated by government agencies to ensure their
            safety, effectiveness, and proper use.
          </p>
          <p>
            After visiting a doctor and receiving a prescription for your medication, you have to visit a nearby local
            pharmacy for medication fulfillment. Local pharmacies are typically conveniently located in proximity to
            your residential area.Your local pharmacy is where you can get the medications prescribed by your doctor.
            Some pharmacies are located inside of a grocery or large "chain" store. Examples of such pharmacies include
            CVS, Walgreens, Rite Aid, Walmart Pharmacy, and Target Pharmacy. Remember to have the full address,
            including the zip code, of your chosen pharmacy on hand for easy access and accuracy.

            Prescription Process
          </h5>

          <p class="ms-3">
            First, you need to visit a healthcare professional who will assess your condition and provide a
            prescription. Then, you can choose a pharmacy of your preference, whether it's a chain, independent, or
            online pharmacy. You can submit the prescription to the chosen pharmacy either physically, electronically,
            or by mail. The pharmacist will verify the prescription and may contact your healthcare provider for
            clarification if needed. If you have insurance, the pharmacy will process the prescription through your plan
            to determine coverage and copayment. Once verified, the pharmacist will dispense the medication and provide
            instructions. You can pick up the prescription or opt for home delivery services. It is crucial to follow
            the prescribed dosage and consult your healthcare provider or pharmacist for any concerns or questions you
            may have.

            A campus health center is a medical facility located on a college or university campus that provides
            healthcare services to students. These centers often offer a range of services, including primary care,
            preventive care, mental health support, and health education. They aim to promote the well-being and address
            the healthcare needs of students within the campus community. Campus health centers primarily serve
            students, so you may need to be enrolled at the university or college to access their services. It's
            important to check if there are any eligibility requirements or restrictions in place.

            The cost of services at a campus health center can vary depending on the specific institution and the
            services provided. Many campus health centers offer basic healthcare services at no or low cost to students
            as part of their tuition or fees. However, additional services, medications, or specialized treatments may
            incur additional charges. It is best to check with your specific campus health center or review your
            university's policies to understand the cost structure and any potential fees associated with the services
            you may require.

            health centers may offer walk-in appointments, while others require you to schedule in advance. It is
            important to familiarize yourself with the specific procedures and protocols of your campus health center to
