    			<p>The F-1 visa is a type of non-immigrant visa which is issued for international students who are studying in the United States. The F-1 visa enables students to enter the U.S. for the purpose of full-time study at accredited colleges, universities, seminaries, conservatories, high schools, and language training programs.</p>
			<p>F-1 visa provides a lot of flexibility for the students including the ability to work on campus, and, under certain conditions, engage in optional practical training (OPT) or curricular practical training (CPT). However, maintaining F-1 status also comes with responsibilities. Students must remain enrolled <strong>Full Time</strong> and maintain satisfactory academic progress.</p>
<div class="alert alert-primary" role="alert">
It is important to keep yourself informed about any changes in immigration or work regulations that may affect international students. Regularly check the official websites of USCIS, SEVIS, and the U.S. Department of State for updates on work regulations and visa requirements specific to international students.</div>

        			<p>Navigating the complexities of an F-1 visa can be overwhelming for international students in the United States. This guide provides a comprehensive overview of the key requirements for maintaining F-1 visa status, including adhering to full-time status, possessing a valid passport, updating your local address, and attending the school specified on your I-20 form. Adhering to these regulations is critical for preserving your eligibility to study in the U.S. and avoiding potential legal complications. This guide will break down each requirement and offer insights into how you can effectively manage your F-1 visa status while pursuing your academic goals.</p>

                    <h5>Full Time Status</h5>
            		<p class="ms-3">Universities and colleges have different requirements for what it means for a student to be considered <strong>Full Time</strong>. But generally, this means taking a number of courses during the Fall and Spring semesters. For example, if you are enrolled in <a href="https://summeraid.berkeley.edu/how-aid-works/eligibility/#:~:text=Maintain%20satisfactory%20academic%20progress.,is%20considered%20full%2Dtime%20enrollment">UC Berkeley</a>, this typically means taking 12 units during the semester, or 6-course units for <a href="https://ois.usc.edu/students/maintainingstudentstatus/">USC</a>. Please make sure to check your school’s requirements for the specific number of courses/units required. However, the summer semester is excluded from this requirement and the students are not required to register for any courses then.</p>
		<p class="ms-3">There are some exceptions to the above rule in some colleges. For example, if a PhD student passes the qualifying exam, then they may be able to take fewer courses to be considered a full-time student. For the exact details, we recommend that you refer to your university’s international office website.</p>
		<p class="ms-3">The international office of your university may also allow certain exceptions beyond the above. So in case you ran into issues and could not enroll in enough units, you may want to contact the international office and see if they could provide you with approval for enrolling in fewer units.</p>

                    <h5>Reduced Course Load (RCL)</h5>
            		<p class="ms-3">F-1 international students in the United States are generally required to maintain a full course load in order to maintain their F-1 status. However, there are exceptions to this rule, known as Reduced Course Load (RCL). An RCL allows an F-1 student to take fewer courses than the full course load requirement, under certain circumstances.</p>

<ul>
	<li><strong>Academic Difficulty</strong>: A student who is having initial difficulties with the English language, unfamiliarity with U.S. teaching methods, or improper course placement may request an RCL for academic difficulty. This option is only available during the student's first academic year.</li>
	<li><strong>Medical Conditions</strong>: A student who is experiencing a temporary illness or medical condition may be eligible for an RCL. A note from a licensed medical doctor or licensed clinical psychologist is required.</li>
	<li><strong>Completing Course of Study in Current Term</strong>: If a student is in their final term of study and doesn’t need a full course load to complete their program, they may take a reduced course load.</li>
</ul>
		<p class="ms-3">A student who is eligible and wants to take an RCL must request it from their Designated School Official (DSO), typically found in the international student office. The DSO will review the request and, if appropriate, approve it and update the student's SEVIS record.</p>
		<p class="ms-3">There are some limitations associated with an RCL:</p>

<ul>
	<li>A student may only be authorized for an RCL due to academic difficulties for one term during their entire program.</li>
	<li>If an RCL is approved for a medical condition, it is typically granted for a period of one term, but it can be extended with proper documentation for up to 12 months cumulatively.</li>
	<li>Students must still make progress towards completing their degree, even with an RCL.</li>
</ul>
		<p class="ms-3">Failure to obtain the proper authorization for an RCL or failing to resume a full course load after the RCL period has ended can result in the student falling out of status, which can have serious consequences for their F-1 status.</p>
		<p class="ms-3">Please note that regulations and policies can change over time, so it is important for students to check with their DSO and keep up-to-date with any changes. For more details, we recommend reaching out to your school’s international office and also studying <a href="https://studyinthestates.dhs.gov/sevis-help-hub/student-records/manage-program-dates-registration-and-course-load/reduced-course">DHS guidelines</a>.</p>

                    <h5>Valid Passport</h5>
            		<p class="ms-3">You need to make sure your passport is always valid for at least 6 months. Make sure to make plans well ahead of this to renew your passport. Please refer to the Identification section to learn more about renewal of Iranian passports in the US.</p>

                    <h5>Keep Your Local Address Updated</h5>
            		<p class="ms-3">Most universities require that you update the international office when you change your residence address. Typically they require that you update your address within 30 days of any change to your primary residence.</p>

                    <h5>Attend the School on Your I-20</h5>
            		<p class="ms-3">When entering the US, you need to be enrolled in the university and program that is stated in your I-20. Typically, you are required to attend at least one semester in that school/program, but after that you can transition or transfer to another program or school if you get admission. In that case, the program/college will issue a new I-20 form for you. You need to always have a valid I-20 form for the program that you are enrolled in at any moment.</p>

        			<p>As an international student with F-1 visa status, you need to strictly follow the employment rules. In case you have any questions about this, make sure to contact your international office.</p>

                    <h5>On-campus Employment</h5>
            		<p class="ms-3">This type of employment typically does not require approval from the international office but needs to be less than or equal to 20 hours per week. You are not allowed to work for more hours on campus, unless you have approval from the international office. The only exception to this is the summer session, during which you can be employed for more hours on campus.</p>

                    <h5>Off Campus Employment</h5>
            		<p class="ms-3">This form of employment requires <strong>prior approval</strong> from the international office and can be done through either Curricular Practical Training or Optional Practical Training. These are explained in more details in the next section below.</p>

                    <h5>Exception for Special Student Relief Provisions</h5>
            		<p class="ms-3">There are certain exceptions for the employment rules in a program called Special Student Relief (SSR) which allows temporary measures implemented by the U.S. Department of Homeland Security (DHS) to assist F-1 students from designated countries that are experiencing emergent circumstances. SSR provisions can be introduced for F-1 students in response to events such as natural disasters, armed conflict, or economic crises in their home countries. SSR provisions can provide targeted and temporary immigration-related relief to affected F-1 students.</p>
		<p class="ms-3">The types of relief provided under SSR can vary depending on the circumstances and the specific designation, but may include:</p>

<ul>
	<li><strong>Employment Authorization</strong>: F-1 students affected by SSR provisions may be eligible for off-campus employment authorization. This allows students to work off-campus and earn income to support themselves, as they may face financial difficulties due to the emergent circumstances in their home countries.</li>
	<li><strong>Reduced Course Load</strong>: Under SSR, eligible F-1 students may be allowed to take a reduced course load or even enroll part-time while still maintaining their F-1 status. Normally, F-1 students are required to be enrolled full-time to maintain their visa status, but SSR provisions can provide flexibility in enrollment requirements.</li>
	<li><strong>Extension of Duration of Status</strong>: SSR provisions may allow eligible F-1 students to extend their duration of status (D/S) in the U.S., providing them with additional time to complete their academic programs.</li>
</ul>
		<p class="ms-3">It is important to note that SSR provisions are temporary measures that are implemented on a case-by-case basis and are only applicable to F-1 students from designated countries experiencing emergent circumstances. The specific eligibility criteria and types of relief offered can vary depending on the SSR designation and the circumstances prompting the relief.</p>
		<p class="ms-3">If you would like to apply for this program you need to first reach out to your Designated School Official (DSO) for their guidance on eligibility and the application process.</p>
		<p class="ms-3">Please note that immigration policies and regulations can change, and it is important to stay informed about any updates or changes. For more details, please contact your school’s international office, and visit <a href="https://www.uscis.gov/newsroom/alerts/uscis-issues-clarifying-guidance-for-individuals-authorized-to-work-under-special-student-relief">USCIS page</a> for more detailed information.</p>

    			<p>Curricular Practical Training (CPT) is an off-campus employment opportunity for F-1 visa holders to get training related to their field of study through employment in an off-campus entity. That is, the employment must be a required component of the student's academic program or earn them academic credit. Typically, the student’s academic advisor signs a form that explains how the employment is related to the student's field of study or attests that the employment is a requirement for obtaining a degree.</p>

        			<p>One other important requirement of CPT is that the students are not allowed to accrue more than 12 months of full-time employment for the duration of their program. If a student passes this limit, it can affect their F-1 eligibility and/or their ability to apply for OPT after graduation. It is often recommended to keep the total number of months on full-time CPT to be 11 months and leave 1 month out. However, part-time CPT employment where the student is employed for less than 20 hours per week is typically not counted towards this limit. An example use case here is when the student has part-time employment in a company while in school during the fall and spring semesters.</p>
			<p>An important point about the 12 months CPT limit is that this limit resets when you start a new program or degree. For example, if a PhD student obtains a master's degree during their study, then this limit resets again to 12 months.</p>

        			<p>For cases where the student needs to be employed for more time than the above limit, they may be able to use Pre-OPT. That program allows the students to use their OPT visa before they graduate. However, the number of months employed while on Pre-OPT will deduct from your total OPT limit, as explained next.</p>
			<p>Unlike Optional Practical Training (OPT), which students can use before or after completion of their studies, CPT is only available before graduation. Additionally, students must have completed one academic year in F-1 status before they can start CPT unless their program requires immediate participation.</p>

    			<p>Optional Practical Training (OPT) is a temporary employment authorization that allows F-1 visa students to gain practical experience in their chosen field of study. Unlike CPT, which is directly related to the student's curriculum, OPT offers broader opportunities for students to work in positions related to their major area of study, either before or after they complete their academic program. There are two main types of OPT:</p>

<ul>
	<li><strong>Pre-completion OPT</strong>: This allows students to work up to 20 hours a week while school is in session (and full-time during breaks) after they have completed one academic year.</li>
	<li><strong>Post-completion OPT</strong>: This typically starts after the student graduates. Students can work full-time for up to 12 months in total.</li>
</ul>

        			<p>Students who have earned degrees in certain science, technology, engineering, or math (STEM) fields might be eligible for a 24-month extension of their post-completion OPT, resulting in a total potential OPT period of 36 months. To qualify for this extension, students must work for an employer who is enrolled in the U.S. government's E-Verify program.</p>
