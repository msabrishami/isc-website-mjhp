                    <p>Before we delve into the details, it's essential to comprehend the concept of tuition. In the United States, tuition refers to the price you pay for instruction at a university or college. This can be a substantial cost, especially for international students, but there are numerous sources of financial aid available that can help you manage these expenses.</p>
        
                    <p>Financial aid refers to various forms of monetary assistance provided to individuals, typically students, to help them cover the costs associated with education. These costs can include tuition, fees, textbooks, housing, meals, and other educational expenses. Financial aid aims to make education more accessible and affordable, especially for those who might not have the means to fully cover these expenses on their own.</p>
        
                    <p>The financial aid can take several forms, such as grants, scholarships, work-study, or loans.</p>

            <p class="ms-3">Free Application for Federal Student Aid. A form used to apply for federal and sometimes state financial aid.</p>

                        <h5>Expected Family Contribution (EFC)</h5>
            <p class="ms-3">The Expected Family Contribution (EFC) is a crucial factor in the financial aid process for college or university. It's a calculated amount that represents how much a student and their family are expected to contribute towards their education expenses for a specific academic year. The EFC is determined by the information provided in the FAFSA. It affects financial aid eligibility.</p>
<div class="alert alert-primary" role="alert">
You can get an estimate of your EFC value using its official government link.</div>

                        <h5>Satisfactory Academic Progress (SAP)</h5>
            <p class="ms-3">To continue receiving federal financial aid, students must maintain satisfactory academic progress, which often includes meeting GPA and completion rate requirements.</p>

                        <h5>Cost of Attendance (COA)</h5>
            <p class="ms-3">The total estimated cost of attending a college or university, including tuition, fees, room, board, books, and other expenses.</p>

    						</div>
    					</div>	
        <p>A grant is a type of financial aid provided to students, individuals, organizations, or projects with the purpose of supporting their education, research, or specific initiatives. Grants are funds that are typically awarded based on specific criteria, such as financial need, academic achievement, research goals, or other qualifying factors. Unlike loans, grants do not need to be repaid, making them a valuable source of financial assistance.</p>

                        <h5>Pell grant</h5>
            <p class="ms-3">The Pell Grant is a federal need-based grant provided by the U.S. Department of Education to eligible undergraduate students pursuing their first bachelor's degree. It is one of the largest sources of federal financial aid for students with limited financial resources. The amount of the Pell Grant varies based on the student's financial need, cost of attendance at the chosen institution, and enrollment status (full-time or part-time). The Pell Grant does not require repayment and is intended to help low-income students afford higher education.</p>

                        <h5>Cal Grant</h5>
            <p class="ms-3">The Cal Grant is a type of financial aid program specific to the state of California. It provides need-based grants to California residents pursuing higher education in California colleges, universities, and career technical schools. There are several types of Cal Grants, including the Cal Grant A, Cal Grant B, and Cal Grant C. Each type of Cal Grant has its own eligibility requirements and award amounts.</p>
<ul>
<li>Cal Grant A: This grant is intended for students pursuing academic and career-oriented programs. It covers tuition and fees at public colleges and provides a stipend for educational expenses.</li>
<li>Cal Grant B: Cal Grant B provides a living allowance and additional funds for low-income students. It assists with tuition and fees and includes a stipend for educational costs.</li>
<li>Cal Grant C: This grant is focused on vocational or technical education programs. It helps cover education and training costs.</li>
</ul>
                        <h5>University Grant</h5>
            <p class="ms-3">A University Grant is a type of financial aid provided directly by colleges or universities to their students. Unlike federal grants that come from the government, university grants are institution-specific and are funded by the college or university itself. University grants can be need-based or merit-based, and their eligibility criteria and award amounts vary from institution to institution. These grants are often intended to bridge the gap between the cost of attendance and other financial aid sources, making education more affordable for students attending that specific school.</p>

                        <h5>Need-Based Grants</h5>
            <p class="ms-3">Need-based grants are awarded to individuals or students who demonstrate a significant financial need based on their family's income, assets, and other financial circumstances. These grants are designed to make education more accessible to those who may not have the means to cover educational expenses.</p>

                        <h5>Merit-Based Grants</h5>
            <p class="ms-3">Merit-based grants are awarded to individuals who have demonstrated exceptional academic achievements, talents, skills, or accomplishments in specific areas such as academics, sports, arts, community service, or leadership. These grants are often a recognition of a person's outstanding abilities and contributions.</p>

                        <h5>Project Grants</h5>
            <p class="ms-3">Project grants are provided to organizations, researchers, or individuals working on specific projects or initiatives that align with the goals and priorities of the grant provider. These grants may support research, community development, arts, sciences, and other projects that contribute to societal progress.</p>

                        <h5>Institutional Grants</h5>
            <p class="ms-3">Some colleges and universities offer institutional grants to their students. These grants are often based on financial need but can also include merit-based components. Institutional grants are intended to make education more affordable for students attending a specific institution.</p>

    						</div>
    					</div>	
        <p>A scholarship is a financial award given to individuals to help them pursue their education or further their skills in a particular area. Scholarships are typically provided by educational institutions, private organizations, foundations, corporations, government agencies, and individuals. They are awarded based on various criteria, which can include academic excellence, talents, achievements, leadership skills, community involvement, field of study, and financial need.</p>

                        <h5>PhD Fellowship</h5>
            <p class="ms-3">Some PhD programs offer “Fellowship” to their selected candidates. The recipient of fellowship is not required to do Research Assistantship (RA) or Teaching Assistantship (TA) to be paid. This award is considered as a scholarship and therefore such students are not considered to be employed by the University. Most schools offer conditional fellowships, which means the recipient should address criterias, such as a minimum GPA, so their fellowship remains valid.</p>

    							<h2 class="h4">Loans</h2>
    						</div>
    					</div>	
        <p>A loan is a borrowed sum of money that is provided by a lender to a borrower with the understanding that the borrower will repay the borrowed amount along with interest over a specified period. Loans are a common way for individuals, businesses, and organizations to finance various expenses, including education, home purchases, business ventures, and more. Unlike grants or scholarships, loans need to be repaid according to the terms and conditions agreed upon.</p>

                        <h5>Federal</h5>
            <p class="ms-3">Federal loans are loans offered by the U.S. Department of Education through various programs to help students and their families finance education. These loans often have more favorable terms and repayment options compared to private loans. The three main types of federal loans are:</p>
<ul>
<li>Subsidized: These loans are need-based and available to undergraduate students. The government pays the interest while the borrower is in school, during the six-month grace period after leaving school, and during authorized deferment periods. Subsidized loans help reduce the overall cost of borrowing.</li>
<li>Unsubsidized: These loans are available to both undergraduate and graduate students, regardless of financial need. Interest starts accruing from the time the loan is disbursed, even while the borrower is in school. Students have the option to pay the interest while in school or defer it, which leads to interest capitalization (adding the accrued interest to the principal balance).</li>
<li>PLUS: Parent PLUS loans are available to parents of dependent undergraduate students, and Graduate PLUS loans are available to graduate and professional students. These loans have higher interest rates and allow borrowing up to the cost of attendance minus other financial aid received.</li>
</ul>
                        <h5>Private (Internationals)</h5>
            <p class="ms-3">Private loans, also known as alternative loans, are offered by private lenders such as banks, credit unions, and online financial institutions. These loans are not backed by the federal government, and their terms vary widely based on the lender. Private loans may be used for educational expenses but often come with higher interest rates and less favorable repayment options compared to federal loans. Eligibility for private loans depends on the borrower's creditworthiness, and a co-signer is sometimes required, especially for students with limited credit history.</p>

                    <section id="secidworkstudy">

    							<h2 class="h4">Work Study</h2>
    						</div>
    					</div>	
        <p>A work-study program is a form of financial aid that provides students with part-time employment opportunities, often on campus, to help them earn money to cover educational expenses. Work-study programs are available in many colleges and universities as part of their financial aid packages. These programs aim to offer students practical work experience while helping them offset the costs of their education.</p>
<p>Once awarded work-study, students can explore job openings offered by their institution. These jobs can range from administrative roles to positions in academic departments, libraries, student services, research projects, and more. On-campus positions are common, but some schools may also have off-campus work-study opportunities with community organizations or local businesses.</p>
<p>Students typically work part-time hours, usually around 10 to 20 hours per week. The number of hours may be limited to ensure that students can balance their work-study job with their academic responsibilities. Earnings are paid directly to the student in the form of a paycheck.</p>
<p>Work-study positions often pay at least the federal minimum wage, but some jobs might offer higher wages depending on the type of work and the skills required. Institutions usually understand that academics are a priority, so they often work with students to create flexible schedules that accommodate their class schedules and academic commitments.</p>

                        <h5>Employment Based Payment</h5>
            <p class="ms-3">It is important to understand that teaching assistantship (TAship), research assistantship (RAship), grader, or mentorship positions are not considered as financial aids. Students are paid for such positions. For more information, please refer to the section related to working regulations for students.</p>
