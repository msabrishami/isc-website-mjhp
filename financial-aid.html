                Before we delve into the details, it's essential to comprehend the concept of tuition. 
                In the United States, tuition refers to the price you pay for instruction at a university or college. 
                This can be a substantial cost, especially for international students, 
                but there are numerous sources of financial aid available that can help you manage these expenses. 
                
                Financial aid refers to various forms of monetary assistance provided to individuals, typically students, 
                to help them cover the costs associated with education. 
                These costs can include tuition, fees, textbooks, housing, meals, and other educational expenses. 
                Financial aid aims to make education more accessible and affordable, 
                especially for those who might not have the means to fully cover these expenses on their own. 
                
                The financial aid can take several forms, such as grants, scholarships, work-study, or loans.

                organizations, or projects with the purpose of supporting their education,

                A loan is a borrowed sum of money that is provided by a lender to a borrower with 
                the understanding that the borrower will repay the borrowed amount along with 
                interest over a specified period. Loans are a common way for individuals, businesses, 
                and organizations to finance various expenses, including education, home purchases, 
                business ventures, and more. Unlike grants or scholarships, loans need to be repaid 
                according to the terms and conditions agreed upon.

                      <strong>Unsubsidized:</strong> These loans are available to both undergraduate and graduate students, 
                      regardless of financial need. Interest starts accruing from the time the loan is disbursed, 
                      even while the borrower is in school. Students have the option to pay the interest 
                      while in school or defer it, which leads to interest capitalization 
                      (adding the accrued interest to the principal balance).

                        professional students. These loans have higher interest rates and allow borrowing 
                        up to the cost of attendance minus other financial aid received.

                  <strong>Private (Internationals):</strong> Private loans, also known as alternative loans, 
                  are offered by private lenders such as banks, credit unions, and online financial institutions. 
                  These loans are not backed by the federal government, and their terms vary widely based on the lender. 
                  Private loans may be used for educational expenses but often come with higher interest rates and less
                   favorable repayment options compared to federal loans. Eligibility for private loans depends 
                   on the borrower's creditworthiness, and a co-signer is sometimes required, especially for students with
                    limited credit history.

                A work-study program is a form of financial aid that provides students with part-time 
                employment opportunities, often on campus, to help them earn money to cover 
                educational expenses. Work-study programs are available in many colleges and 
                universities as part of their financial aid packages. These programs aim to offer 
                students practical work experience while helping them offset the costs of their education.
                <br />
                Once awarded work-study, students can explore job openings offered by their institution.
                 These jobs can range from administrative roles to positions in academic departments, 
                 libraries, student services, research projects, and more. On-campus positions are 
                 common, but some schools may also have off-campus work-study opportunities with 
                 community organizations or local businesses. 
                <br />
                Students typically work part-time hours, usually around 10 to 20 hours per week. 
                The number of hours may be limited to ensure that students can balance their work-study
                 job with their academic responsibilities. Earnings are paid directly to the student in
                  the form of a paycheck.
                <br />
                Work-study positions often pay at least the federal minimum wage, but some jobs 
                might offer higher wages depending on the type of work and the skills required. 
                Institutions usually understand that academics are a priority, so they often work 
                with students to create flexible schedules that accommodate their class schedules
                 and academic commitments.

                Financial aid eligibility for international students can vary significantly 
                depending on the country, institution, and specific program. Many 
                countries and institutions offer scholarships and financial aid for international 
                students, often based on academic achievement, leadership potential, or other 
                unique criteria. Language proficiency (e.g., English proficiency for international 
                students) and specific requirements for international applicants may also play a role.

                  <strong>Gather Required Documents and Information: </strong>
                  <br />
                  Before you start, gather the necessary documents and information:
                  <ul>
                    <li>
                      Social Security Number (SSN) or Alien Registration Number (if not a U.S. citizen)
                    </li>
                    <li>
                      Federal Income Tax Returns (yours and your parents', if dependent)
                    </li>
                    <li>
                      Records of untaxed income (e.g., child support, interest income)
                    </li>
                    <li>
                      Bank statements and records of investments
                    </li>
                    <li>
                      FSA ID (created on the Federal Student Aid website)
                    </li>
                  </ul>
                </li>

                <li>
                  <strong>Create an FSA ID: </strong>
                  <br />
                  You will fill out the FAFSA online, and in order to sign in you will need an FSA ID.
                  You will need an Federal Student Aid (FSA) ID and so will one parent. 
                  This ID will serve as your electronic signature and grant access to FAFSA online.
                  It can take a few days for your FSA ID to become active, so I recommend doing this 
                  before you are actually filling out your FAFSA. 
                </li>

                <li>
                  <strong>Start the FAFSA Application: </strong>
                  <br />
                  To get started filling out the FAFSA, head over to the 
                  <a href="https://studentaid.gov/h/apply-for-aid/fafsa">FAFSA website</a> to get started. 
                  On the login page, click “I am the student” and then you will be asked to enter your 
                  FSA ID username and password. The following describes the pages you’ll see as you go 
                  through the FAFSA and how to complete them.
                </li>

                <li>
                  <strong>Choose the Correct Year: </strong>
                  <br />
                  This is slightly tricky and a common mistake when student’s fill out the FAFSA! 
                  You are applying for financial aid for NEXT school year, so make sure to select 
                  the following year, not the current one. For example, if you are filling out the 
                  FAFSA in the Fall of 2023, you will fill out the 2024-25 FAFSA (not the 23-24 FAFSA).
                </li>

                <li>
                  <strong>Personal Information: </strong>
                  <br />
                  In this section, you answer basic information about yourself. 
                  This page is extremely important because if you make a mistake on your name, 
                  birthdate or social security number it’s very hard to fix later.
                  <br />
                  Make sure you enter your social security number exactly right and that your 
                  name matches your social security card exactly. This is your legal name and the 
                  one you need to use to fill out the FAFSA.
                  <br />
                  Next it will ask for your email, phone number and address. 
                  Those will probably fill automatically from your FSA ID log in.
                  <br />
                  The next page covers your state of residency (answer how long you have lived there)
                   and your citizenship status. FAFSA is for US Citizens and eligible non citizens. 
                   <br/>
                   The next section covers your education and your education plans. 
                   It asks what your high school completion status will be the next school year 
                   (select high school graduate, GED or homeschool) as well as what degree
                    you’ll be working on. For this, select “1st Bachelor’s degree“. 
                    <br/>
                    If you’re a high school student or continuing college student, 
                    you will not have completed a bachelor’s degree (four year degree) 
                    by the next school year so answer no to this question.
                    <div class="alert alert-primary" role="alert">
                      <strong>Important</strong>
                      <br />
                      If you are a high school senior starting college next year, 
                      you will select “first year, never attended college” EVEN IF you did 
                      running start or another program where you earned college credit as a high school student.
                    </div>
                    Say “yes” to being considered for work study because you want to have all 
                    possible options available to you! You do NOT have to take a work study 
                    job if you say yes to this question.
                    <br/>
                    Note that if you are male, you are required to register for the selective service. 
                    You can register within the FAFSA application but it does not affect your eligibility 
                    for money for college. Registering for the selective service is NOT joining the military. 
                    It is registering for the draft, which is required by law for males. 
                    The last time the draft was used to bring people into the military was in 1972.
                    <br/>
                    The student demographics section of FAFSA wraps up with asking you for your driver’s 
                    license number (leave blank if you don’t have one), if you’ve been in foster care and 
                    the highest level of education completed by your parent or parents.

                  <strong>Dependency Status: </strong>
                  This section asks a series of questions that determine if you are a dependent or independent student.
                  <br/>
                  For most high school and college students the answer here is YES. 
                  The system in the United States is based on parents paying for college 
                  even if the student is over 18 and most students are dependent, 
                  which means they will provide parent information. You will need to do this 
                  even if your parents will not be paying for college. Their income will still 
                  determine your eligibility for different types of financial aid.
                  <br/>
                  You are an independent student if any of the following apply to you:
                  <ul>
                    <li>
                      Are 24 years old or older
                    </li>
                    <li>
                      Are active duty in the military or are a veteran
                    </li>
                    <li>
                      Are married
                    </li>
                    <li>
                      Have a child who you are supporting
                    </li>
                    <li>
                      Have a legal guardian
                    </li>
                    <li>
                      Have been in foster care since you were 13
                    </li>
                    <li>
                      Are homeless
                    </li>
                  </ul>
                  Keep in mind that if you are under 24 and any of these situations apply to you, 
                  colleges will ask for documentation that proves that situation applies to you, 
                  so make sure to gather those documents now so you are ready to provide them when 
                  asked (you will not need them to fill out FAFSA, but you will need them later). 
                  You will not be able to receive financial aid without providing this documentation.
                  <br/>
                  Based on your answers, if you ARE an independent student, you will not see the next 
                  set of questions about parents. If you are a dependent student, then you WILL see 
                  questions about your parents which you will need to answer.
                </li>

                <li>
                  <strong>Parental Information (Dependent Students): </strong>
                  <br />
                  You only see these questions if you are dependent. 
                  The first question is about your parent/parents ' marital status. 
                  If you have a single parent, you will only answer questions about that parent. 
                  If your parents are married, or the parent who provides the most financial support 
                  to you is married to a step parent, you will provide information about both parents.
                  <br/>
                  If you have undocumented parents, enter all zeros for your parent’s social security number.
                  You will then answer questions about your parents state of residence and household size. 
                  Note that it’s possible the household size will be different from what your parents report on taxes. 
                  That’s totally ok when you fill out the FAFSA.
                  <br/>
                  For their financial information, The first question is if your parents have filed taxes 
                  for the previous year. Then, you may have the option to securely transfer tax information 
                  from the IRS to the FAFSA. This is called “IRS data retrieval”. If you have this option, 
                  definitely take it! It makes sure that you can’t make a mistake entering information and it 
                  also makes it less likely that you’ll need to provide additional documentation to your colleges. 
                  If possible, use the IRS Data Retrieval tool, this makes the FAFSA go faster and requires less 
                  verification later. If you don’t see this button or have this option, it’s no big deal, you can 
                  enter it manually.
                  <br/>
                  If your parents are undocumented you will not be able to do IRS data retrieval, 
                  even if your parents pay taxes with an ITIN. You also will not be able to use it 
                  if your parents information including their address does not exactly match their tax forms.
                  <br/>
                  When asked what programs your parents or family members receive, again, 
                  if you don’t know what it is, you probably don’t have it. If you do have it, 
                  then click the box. If your parents are undocumented you will not see these 
                  questions for them because they are federal social programs.
                  The three pages have a lot of questions about various income related things 
                  that might or might not apply to you. In general, if your parents don't know what it is,
                   they probably don’t have it. 
                   <br/>
                  The last page of this section has three questions dealing with your 
                  parents bank accounts and investments.
                  <br/>
                  For the balance of checking and savings accounts, an estimate is fine. 
                  Most people don’t have a consistent amount of money in their accounts and 
                  that’s totally fine. An estimate is fine.
                  For real estate investments, do not include the value of your 
                  parents home if they own it. This is where you include other real estate 
                  or money (called assets) that your parents own, if any. If they don’t have 
                  any assets, just leave it with a zero. Similarly, for the final question about 
                  business, this does not apply to most small family owned businesses with less than 100 employees.

                  <strong>School Selection: </strong>
                  <br />
                  This part of filling out the FAFSA starts with the name, 
                  city and state of your high school. Click “search” and then 
                  click on the result that matches your high school.
                  <br/>
                  Next, you’ll select the colleges you’d like to have your FAFSA sent to. 
                  You do not need to know their code, you can just enter the information 
                  in the boxes and it will bring up options for you to select 
                  (similar to what you did for your high school).
                  <div class="alert alert-primary" role="alert">
                    <strong>Important:</strong>
                    Send the FAFSA to every college you are considering applying to, 
                    including two year colleges and trade or technical schools. 
                    You can enter up to 10 schools. If you are applying to more than 10, 
                    after your FAFSA is processed and sent to colleges you can go back in 
                    and change some of them to get them all. DO NOT WAIT until you have applied or been accepted!
                  </div>
                  For housing plans, I always recommend choosing that you plan to live on campus. 
                  This is because it makes you eligible for the most aid and it’s good to keep your options open! 
                  It’s much easier to later decide to live at home than it is to later decide to live on campus. 
                  If you are 100% sure that you are going to be living at home 
                  (and you can commute to all the colleges you are applying to) 
                  then it’s fine to say “with parents” or “off campus”. 
                  If there is any chance you might live on campus make sure to select that.

                  <strong>Dependency Overrides (If Applicable): </strong>
                  <br />
                  If you believe you have special circumstances that warrant a dependency override, 
                  explain your situation. This is reviewed by the school's financial aid office.

                  <strong>Student Financial Information: </strong>
                  <br />
                  This section is questions about the student’s finances. 
                  Most high school students do not earn enough money to pay taxes 
                  (though some do) so if you haven’t paid taxes and don’t have your 
                  own bank account that’s no problem. Just put zeros for any questions that don’t apply to you.
                  <br/>
                  Only include information here for accounts that are in your name.
                  <br/>
                  Similar to parent financial information, if there are things that you don’t 
                  know what they are, you probably don’t have them.
                  <br/>
                  Make sure to check the box for free and reduced lunch if you receive that at school.
                  <br/>
                  In the child support box, remember that this is for you the student. 
                  If your parent receives child support for you, they will enter that in the parent 
                  information. You would only enter it here if you, the student, are receiving 
                  child support for your own child that you are supporting.

                  If your parent is unable to get a PIN to sign, you can also print a 
                  signature page and mail it in. This takes longer to process, 
                  but works just fine. Parents who are undocumented or green card 
                  holders will have to print and mail the signature page. Make sure not to miss this step!

                First you need to research private lenders that offer student loans. 
                Compare interest rates, repayment terms, and benefits. You can follow these steps:
              </p>
              <ol>
                <li>
                  <strong>Check Eligibility: </strong>Review the eligibility criteria for each lender, including credit score requirements, enrollment status, and other factors.
                </li>
                <li>
                  <strong>Gather Information: </strong>Prepare your personal and financial information, including Social Security number, income details, and employment information.
                </li>
                <li>
                  <strong>Choose a Co-Signer (if needed): </strong>Private lenders often require a co-signer, especially if you have limited credit history or income. Choose someone with a strong credit history.
                </li>
                <li>
                  <strong>Apply Online: </strong>Fill out the loan application on the lender's website. Provide accurate and complete information. 
                </li>
                <li>
                  <strong>Credit Check: </strong>Most private lenders will conduct a credit check to assess your creditworthiness and determine the loan terms.
                </li>
                <li>
                  <strong>Review Terms: </strong>Carefully review the loan terms, including interest rates, repayment plans, and any fees.
                </li>
                <li>
                  <strong>Accept Loan Offer: </strong>If approved, review and accept the loan offer. Make sure you understand the terms and obligations.
                </li>
                <li>
                  <strong>Complete Promissory Note: </strong>Sign the loan's promissory note, a legal document outlining the terms and conditions of the loan.
                </li>
                <li>
                  <strong>School Certification: </strong>The lender may require your school to certify your enrollment and the loan amount. This process varies by lender.
                </li>
                <li>
                  <strong>Receive Funds: </strong>Once the loan is approved and certified, the lender will disburse the funds to your school. The school deducts any applicable fees and applies the remaining funds to your tuition and other educational expenses.
                </li>
