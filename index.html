              </div>
              <p>
                There are two primary types of bank accounts in the United
                Statesâ€™ banking system: checking accounts and savings accounts.
                Each account serves a different purpose and understanding the
                difference is the first step towards managing your money
                effectively.
              </p>
              <ul>
                <li>
                  <strong>Checking accounts</strong> are designed for frequent
                  transactions. This is the account where you might receive
                  direct deposits from a job, make purchases using a debit card,
                  write checks, or withdraw cash. Checking accounts are ideal
                  for managing everyday spending and bill payments.
                </li>
                <li>
                  <strong> Savings accounts </strong> are meant for saving
                  money. They often provide interest, which means your money
                  grows over time. Savings accounts are ideal for emergency
                  funds or saving up for future expenses. Typically, you
                  wouldn't make daily transactions from this account.
                </li>
              </ul>

                        Withdrawals are usually made in person, at an ATM, or by
                        transferring to a checking account.

              Some of the major national banks include Bank of America (BoA),
              Wells Fargo, Citibank, and JPMorgan Chase. These banks have
              branches and ATMs spread throughout the country. Alternatively,
              you may choose to bank with a regional bank, which may have fewer
              locations but offer more personalized service. Credit Unions are
              another option; they are member-owned and often offer lower fees.
            </p>
            <p>
              Some of the famous banks providing services to international
              students:
            </p>
            <ul>
              <li>Local campus branches of Credit Union</li>
              <li>Wells Fargo</li>
              <li>Bank of America</li>
            </ul>
            <!-- ======= Note ======= -->
            <div class="alert alert-primary w-50" role="alert">
              The bank branches that are located close to campuses are more
              aware of the process, e.g. required documentation, for
              international students. Unfortunately, it is possible that the
              staff of branches that are not close to university campuses and do
              not have international students as their usual customers and are
              not aware of the process for them, thus they may provide
              inaccurate information.

              For opening an account, you can set an appointment through the
              bankâ€™s website. Some banks might not accept walk-in customers. To
              open a bank account in the U.S., you'll typically need the
              following documents:
            </p>
            <ul>
              <li>
                <strong>Identification</strong>: A passport will usually suffice
                for international students.
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>Proof of Address</strong>: This can be a lease agreement
                or utility bill.

              You can check the promotions for opening an account on the
              internet (They may have referral bonus and also welcome bonus). As
              an example, Wells Fargo used to offer a $300 bonus as reward for
              opening a checking account. However, the promotions and their
              amount are seasonal and may change throughout the year.

              Direct deposit is a method used to transfer money electronically
              from one bank account to another. This is typically how employers
              pay wages in the U.S., directly depositing your salary into your
              checking account. To set this up, you will need to provide your
              employer with your bank account number and the bank's routing
              number.
