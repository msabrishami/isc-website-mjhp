              </div>
              <p>
                There are two primary types of bank accounts in the United
                Statesâ€™ banking system: checking accounts and savings accounts.
                Each account serves a different purpose and understanding the
                difference is the first step towards managing your money
                effectively.
              </p>
              <ul>
                <li>
                  <strong>Checking accounts</strong> are designed for frequent
                  transactions. This is the account where you might receive
                  direct deposits from a job, make purchases using a debit card,
                  write checks, or withdraw cash. Checking accounts are ideal
                  for managing everyday spending and bill payments.
                </li>
                <li>
                  <strong> Savings accounts </strong> are meant for saving
                  money. They often provide interest, which means your money
                  grows over time. Savings accounts are ideal for emergency
                  funds or saving up for future expenses. Typically, you
                  wouldn't make daily transactions from this account.
                </li>
              </ul>

                        Withdrawals are usually made in person, at an ATM, or by
                        transferring to a checking account.

                Some of the major national banks include Bank of America (BoA),
                Wells Fargo, Citibank, and JPMorgan Chase. These banks have
                branches and ATMs spread throughout the country. Alternatively,
                you may choose to bank with a regional bank, which may have
                fewer locations but offer more personalized service. Credit
                Unions are another option; they are member-owned and often offer
                lower fees.

                Some of the famous banks providing services to international

                The bank branches that are located close to campuses are more
                aware of the process, e.g. required documentation, for
                international students. Unfortunately, it is possible that the
                staff of branches that are not close to university campuses and
                do not have international students as their usual customers and
                are not aware of the process for them, thus they may provide
                inaccurate information.

                For opening an account, you can set an appointment through the
                bankâ€™s website. Some banks might not accept walk-in customers.
                To open a bank account in the U.S., you'll typically need the
                following documents:

                Direct deposit is a method used to transfer money electronically
                from one bank account to another. This is typically how
                employers pay wages in the U.S., directly depositing your salary
                into your checking account. To set this up, you will need to
                provide your employer with your bank account number and the
                bank's routing number.

              <p>
                Once your bank account is open, you'll typically receive a debit
                card. This card is linked directly to your checking account.
                When you use it for purchases or to withdraw cash from an ATM,
                the money is immediately deducted from your account.
                <br />
                Your debit card will come with a Personal Identification Number
                (PIN) which you'll use for transactions, especially when
                withdrawing cash from an ATM. It's crucial to keep this number
                private to protect your account.
              </p>
              <h5>Features and Benefits of Debit Cards</h5>
              <ul>
                <li>
                  <strong>Convenience</strong>: A debit card is easy to carry
                  and accepted at most places, making it convenient for everyday
                  purchases.
                </li>
                <li>
                  <strong>Safety</strong>: It's safer than carrying large
                  amounts of cash.
                </li>
                <li>
                  <strong>Controlled Spending</strong>: Since a debit card
                  deducts money directly from your checking account, it can help
                  prevent overspending. You can only spend as much as you have
                  in your account.
                </li>
                <li>
                  <strong>Online Shopping and Bill Payment</strong>: You can use
                  your debit card for online purchases or to set up automatic
                  payments for recurring bills.
                </li>
              </ul>
              <h5>Safety</h5>
              <ul>
                <li>
                  <strong>Protect your PIN</strong>: Don't share your PIN with
                  anyone and avoid writing it down. When using an ATM or a card
                  reader, make sure nobody can see your PIN as you enter it.
                </li>
                <li>
                  <strong>Safety</strong>: It's safer than carrying large
                  amounts of cash.
                </li>
                <li>
                  <strong>Monitor Your Account</strong>: Regularly check your
                  account balance and transactions. If you notice any
                  unauthorized transactions, report them to your bank
                  immediately.
                </li>
                <li>
                  <strong>Know Your Balance</strong>: Keep track of how much
                  money you have in your account. If you use your debit card and
                  don't have sufficient funds in your account, you may incur
                  overdraft fees.
                </li>
              </ul>
              <h5>ATM Use</h5>
              <p>
                ATMs (Automated Teller Machines) allow you to withdraw cash,
                deposit money, and sometimes even perform other banking tasks.
                Keep in mind that using ATMs from a bank other than your own may
                result in additional fees.
              </p>
              <h5>Debit Card vs. Credit Card</h5>
              <p>
                It's important to understand that debit cards and credit cards
                work differently. While debit cards deduct money from your bank
                account immediately, a credit card allows you to borrow money up
                to a certain limit in order to make purchases. You then repay
                this money at the end of your billing cycle. Using a credit card
                can help you build credit history, but it also comes with the
                risk of high interest and fees if not managed properly.
              </p>

                <strong>Tracking Your Transactions and Balances</strong>:
                Regularly review your bank statements (either online or paper
                statements) to check your transactions, including your debit
                card spending. This will help you spot any errors or fraudulent
                activity, keep track of your spending, and avoid overdrawing
                your account.

                When you open a checking account, your bank will provide you
                with a checkbook. Each check contains account information and
                space for you to specify a payment amount and recipient. Checks
                can be used for various purposes, including paying rent, bills,
                or paying someone without needing to handle cash.

              </p>
              <ul>
                <li>
                  <strong>Payee Line</strong>: Here is where you write the name
                  of the person or company to whom you're making the payment.

                <li>
                  <strong>Amount Box and Amount Line</strong>: You write the
                  payment amount in numbers in the box and in words on the line
                  to ensure there's no confusion about the amount you're paying.

                <li>
                  <strong>Memo Line</strong>: This is optional but it can be

                <li>
                  <strong>Signature Line</strong>: You sign the check here.
                  Without your signature, the check won't be valid.

                Some banks offer the ability to write electronic checks, or
                eChecks. This is a form of payment made via the internet
                designed to perform the same function as a conventional paper
                check. Because the information is transmitted digitally, an
                eCheck is often more secure and faster.

                certain fees if you meet specific requirements, such as
                maintaining a minimum balance or making a certain number of
                transactions each month. It's important to understand the fees
                associated with your account to avoid any surprises.

              <ul>
                <li>
                  <strong>Monthly Maintenance Fee</strong>: Some banks charge
                  this fee for the upkeep of your account, though it can often
                  be waived if certain conditions are met.
                </li>
                <li>
                  <strong>Overdraft Fee</strong>: If you spend more money than
                  you have in your checking account, the bank may cover the
                  difference and charge you an overdraft fee.

                <li>
                  <strong>ATM Fee</strong>: While using an ATM from your bank is

                Based on the characteristics of sender and receiver bank account
                or platform, there are many different methods to do money
                transfer.
              </p>
              <h5>ATM</h5>
              <p>
                Automated Teller Machines (ATMs) can be found almost everywhere
                in the U.S., and they allow you to deposit cash or checks,
                withdraw money, and sometimes even pay bills. Your bank's ATMs
                usually offer free services, but using another bank's ATM might
                result in charges.
              </p>
              <h5>Bank Transfers</h5>
              <p>
                Direct bank transfers are a reliable method to transfer money.

              <h5>Online Applications</h5>
              <p>
                Money transfer applications have revolutionized the way we send
                and receive money, providing convenient and efficient
                alternatives to traditional methods. These applications,
                commonly referred to as peer-to-peer payment platforms or mobile
                payment apps, allow users to transfer funds electronically from
                one individual to another using their smartphones or other
                digital devices.
                <br />
                With money transfer apps, you can quickly and securely send
                money to friends, family, or businesses, both domestically and
                internationally. These apps have gained popularity due to their
                ease of use, speed, and often low or no transaction fees.
