              </div>
              <p>
                There are two primary types of bank accounts in the United
                States’ banking system: checking accounts and savings accounts.
                Each account serves a different purpose and understanding the
                difference is the first step towards managing your money
                effectively.
              </p>
              <ul>
                <li>
                  <strong>Checking accounts</strong> are designed for frequent
                  transactions. This is the account where you might receive
                  direct deposits from a job, make purchases using a debit card,
                  write checks, or withdraw cash. Checking accounts are ideal
                  for managing everyday spending and bill payments.
                </li>
                <li>
                  <strong> Savings accounts </strong> are meant for saving
                  money. They often provide interest, which means your money
                  grows over time. Savings accounts are ideal for emergency
                  funds or saving up for future expenses. Typically, you
                  wouldn't make daily transactions from this account.
                </li>
              </ul>

                        Withdrawals are usually made in person, at an ATM, or by
                        transferring to a checking account.

                Some of the major national banks include Bank of America (BoA),
                Wells Fargo, Citibank, and JPMorgan Chase. These banks have
                branches and ATMs spread throughout the country. Alternatively,
                you may choose to bank with a regional bank, which may have
                fewer locations but offer more personalized service. Credit
                Unions are another option; they are member-owned and often offer
                lower fees.

                The bank branches that are located close to campuses are more
                aware of the process, e.g. required documentation, for
                international students. Unfortunately, it is possible that the
                staff of branches that are not close to university campuses and
                do not have international students as their usual customers and
                are not aware of the process for them, thus they may provide
                inaccurate information.

                For opening an account, you can set an appointment through the
                bank’s website. Some banks might not accept walk-in customers.
                To open a bank account in the U.S., you'll typically need the
                following documents:
              </p>
              <ul>
                <li>
                  <strong>Identification</strong>: A passport will usually
                  suffice for international students.
                </li>
                <li>
                  <strong>Proof of Address</strong>: This can be a lease
                  agreement or utility bill.
                </li>
                <li>
                  <strong>Initial Deposit</strong>: Some banks require you to
                  deposit a minimum amount to open an account.
                </li>
                <li>

                  >: Some banks may require this, but not all. As an
                  international student, you can open a bank account without an
                  SSN.
                </li>

                As an example, Wells Fargo used to offer a $300 bonus as reward
                for opening a checking account. However, the promotions and
                their amount are seasonal and may change throughout the year.

                Direct deposit is a method used to transfer money electronically
                from one bank account to another. This is typically how
                employers pay wages in the U.S., directly depositing your salary
                into your checking account. To set this up, you will need to
                provide your employer with your bank account number and the
                bank's routing number.

                Once your bank account is open, you'll typically receive a debit
                card. This card is linked directly to your checking account.
                When you use it for purchases or to withdraw cash from an ATM,
                the money is immediately deducted from your account.
                <br />
                Your debit card will come with a Personal Identification Number
                (PIN) which you'll use for transactions, especially when
                withdrawing cash from an ATM. It's crucial to keep this number
                private to protect your account.
              </p>
              <h5>Features & Benefits of Debit Cards</h5>
              <ul>
                <li>
                  <strong>Convenience</strong>: A debit card is easy to carry
                  and accepted at most places, making it convenient for everyday
                  purchases.
                </li>
                <li>
                  <strong>Safety</strong>: It's safer than carrying large
                  amounts of cash.
                </li>
                <li>
                  <strong>Controlled Spending</strong>: Since a debit card
                  deducts money directly from your checking account, it can help
                  prevent overspending. You can only spend as much as you have
                  in your account.
                </li>
                <li>
                  <strong>Online Shopping and Bill Payment</strong>: You can use
                  your debit card for online purchases or to set up automatic
                  payments for recurring bills.
                </li>
              </ul>
              <h5>Safety</h5>
              <ul>
                <li>
                  <strong>Protect your PIN</strong>: Don't share your PIN with
                  anyone and avoid writing it down. When using an ATM or a card
                  reader, make sure nobody can see your PIN as you enter it.
                </li>
                <li>
                  <strong>Safety</strong>: It's safer than carrying large
                  amounts of cash.
                </li>
                <li>
                  <strong>Monitor Your Account</strong>: Regularly check your
                  account balance and transactions. If you notice any
                  unauthorized transactions, report them to your bank
                  immediately.
                </li>
                <li>
                  <strong>Know Your Balance</strong>: Keep track of how much
                  money you have in your account. If you use your debit card and
                  don't have sufficient funds in your account, you may incur
                  overdraft fees.
                </li>
              </ul>
              <h5>ATM Use</h5>
              <p class="ms-3">
                ATMs (Automated Teller Machines) allow you to withdraw cash,
                deposit money, and sometimes even perform other banking tasks.
                Keep in mind that using ATMs from a bank other than your own may
                result in additional fees.
              </p>
              <h5>Debit Card vs. Credit Card</h5>
              <p class="ms-3">
                It's important to understand that debit cards and credit cards
                work differently. While debit cards deduct money from your bank
                account immediately, a credit card allows you to borrow money up
                to a certain limit in order to make purchases. You then repay
                this money at the end of your billing cycle. Using a credit card
                can help you build credit history, but it also comes with the
                risk of high interest and fees if not managed properly.
              </p>

                <strong>Tracking Your Transactions and Balances</strong>:
                Regularly review your bank statements (either online or paper
                statements) to check your transactions, including your debit
                card spending. This will help you spot any errors or fraudulent
                activity, keep track of your spending, and avoid overdrawing
                your account.

                When you open a checking account, your bank will provide you
                with a checkbook. Each check contains account information and
                space for you to specify a payment amount and recipient. Checks
                can be used for various purposes, including paying rent, bills,
                or paying someone without needing to handle cash.

                Banks often charge fees for their services. Some banks may waive
                certain fees if you meet specific requirements, such as
                maintaining a minimum balance or making a certain number of
                transactions each month. It's important to understand the fees
                associated with your account to avoid any surprises.

                <li>
                  <strong>Overdraft Fee</strong>: If you spend more money than

                  difference and charge you an overdraft fee.

                Based on the characteristics of sender and receiver bank account
                or platform, there are many different methods to do money
                transfer.
              </p>
              <h5>ATM</h5>
              <p class="ms-3">
                Automated Teller Machines (ATMs) can be found almost everywhere
                in the U.S., and they allow you to deposit cash or checks,
                withdraw money, and sometimes even pay bills. Your bank's ATMs
                usually offer free services, but using another bank's ATM might
                result in charges.
              </p>
              <h5>Bank Transfers</h5>
              <p class="ms-3">
                Direct bank transfers are a reliable method to transfer money.
                You can do this online, on the phone, or in person at the bank.
                You’ll need the recipient's bank account number and routing
                number to complete the transfer.
              </p>
              <h5>Online Applications</h5>
              <p class="ms-3">
                Money transfer applications have revolutionized the way we send
                and receive money, providing convenient and efficient
                alternatives to traditional methods. These applications,
                commonly referred to as peer-to-peer payment platforms or mobile
                payment apps, allow users to transfer funds electronically from
                one individual to another using their smartphones or other
                digital devices.
                <br />
                With money transfer apps, you can quickly and securely send
                money to friends, family, or businesses, both domestically and
                internationally. These apps have gained popularity due to their
                ease of use, speed, and often low or no transaction fees.

                        When choosing a bank account for depositing your income,

              <p>
                In simple words, credit score is a numerical representation (a
                three-digit number) of your creditworthiness, providing lenders
                and financial institutions with an assessment of the risk of
                extending credit to you. In the United States, credit scores are
                generated by <strong>credit bureaus</strong> based on the
                information in your <strong>credit report</strong>. The most
                commonly used credit scoring models are the FICO Score and
                VantageScore. These scores typically range from 300 to 850, with
                a higher score indicating better creditworthiness.

              <p>
                Credit is a financial arrangement that allows you to borrow
                money or access goods and services with a promise to repay the
                amount later, usually with interest. It is like receiving
                something of value now and agreeing to pay for it in the future.
                <br />
                When you use credit, you are essentially borrowing money from a
                lender, such as a bank, financial institution, or credit card
                company. The lender trusts that you will repay the money based
                on the terms and conditions agreed upon, which often include
                paying back the borrowed amount over time, along with an
                additional fee called interest.
              </p>
              <p>
                There are different types of credit that you might encounter:
              </p>
              <ul>
                <li>
                  <strong>Loans</strong>: These are specific amounts of money
                  borrowed from a lender that you must repay in fixed
                  installments over a set period. Common examples include car
                  loans, student loans, and home mortgages.
                </li>
                <li>
                  <strong>Credit Cards</strong>: Credit cards allow you to make
                  purchases on credit, up to a predetermined credit limit. You
                  can choose to pay the full balance or a minimum amount each
                  month. If you don't pay the full balance, interest will be
                  added to the remaining amount.
                </li>
                <li>
                  <strong> Lines of Credit </strong>: This is a pre-approved
                  amount of credit that you can access as needed, similar to a
                  credit card. However, it is typically used for larger expenses
                  or emergencies.
                </li>

                  A credit report is a detailed record of an individual's credit
                  history and financial behavior. It serves as a crucial
                  document that provides lenders and other authorized entities
                  with insight into a person's creditworthiness and how they
                  manage their financial obligations. Credit reports are
                  compiled and maintained by credit bureaus, also known as
                  credit reporting agencies, such as Experian, Equifax, and
                  TransUnion.

                    Information recorded in a credit report are:
                  </strong>
                </p>
                <ul>
                  <li>
                    Credit Accounts: Credit reports include information about
                    various credit accounts that an individual holds. This
                    includes credit cards, mortgages, auto loans, personal
                    loans, student loans, and other lines of credit.
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    Payment History: The credit report records the payment
                    history associated with each credit account. It shows
                    whether payments were made on time or if there were any late
                    payments or delinquencies.
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    Credit Utilization: Credit reports indicate the credit
                    utilization ratio for each credit card account. This ratio
                    represents the percentage of available credit that a person
                    is using and is an essential factor in credit score
                    calculations.

                  <li>
                    Public Records: Certain financial events, such as
                    bankruptcies, tax liens, judgments, and foreclosures, are
                    considered public records and are included in the credit
                    report.
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    Credit Inquiries: Credit reports show a list of inquiries
                    made by lenders when an individual applies for credit. There
                    are two types of inquiries: hard inquiries and soft
                    inquiries. Hard inquiries made by lenders when considering a
                    credit application may have a temporary negative impact on
                    the credit score, while soft inquiries, like checking one's
                    own credit report, do not affect the score.
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    Personal Information: The credit report includes personal
                    information such as name, address, date of birth, Social
                    Security number, and employment history. It helps verify the
                    individual's identity and may be used to match their credit
                    history to the correct person.

                    Income: Credit reports do not include information about an
                    individual's income or salary. Lenders typically consider
                    income separately when evaluating credit applications.

                  Credit agencies, also known as credit reporting agencies or
                  credit bureaus, are independent organizations that collect and
                  maintain credit information on individuals and businesses.
                  These agencies play a crucial role in the financial industry
                  by providing credit reports and credit scores to lenders,
                  landlords, employers, and other authorized entities. The
                  information gathered by credit agencies allows these entities
                  to assess the creditworthiness of individuals and make
                  informed decisions about granting credit, offering loans, or
                  extending other financial services. Important credit agencies
                  in the U.S. are:

                  calculation, such as your payment history, credit utilization,
                  length of credit history, types of credit used, and recent
                  credit inquiries. Each of these factors holds a different

              </div>
              <p>
                In the United States, two primary credit scoring models are
                widely used to calculate credit scores: FICO Score and
                VantageScore. Both models assess an individual's
                creditworthiness based on information from credit reports, but
                they have distinct methodologies and may weigh factors
                differently.
              </p>
              <h5>FICO Score</h5>
              <div class="ms-3">
                <p>
                  FICO (Fair Isaac Corporation) Score is one of the oldest and
                  most widely recognized credit scoring models. It was developed
                  by the Fair Isaac Corporation and is widely used by lenders to
                  make credit decisions. FICO Scores range from 300 to 850, with
                  higher scores indicating better creditworthiness.
                </p>
                <p class="mb-0">
                  <strong> Key Features of FICO Score include: </strong>
                </p>
              </div>
              <ul>
                <li>
                  FICO Scores primarily consider factors such as payment
                  history, credit utilization, length of credit history, types
                  of credit used, and recent credit inquiries.
                </li>
                <li>
                  Payment history, especially on-time payments, carries
                  significant weight in the FICO Score calculation.
                </li>
                <li>
                  FICO Scores may consider both positive and negative credit
                  information, including late payments, bankruptcies, and
                  collections.
                </li>
                <li>
                  Public Records: Certain financial events, such as
                  bankruptcies, tax liens, judgments, and foreclosures, are
                  considered public records and are included in the credit
                  report.
                </li>
              </ul>
              <h5>VantageScore</h5>
              <div class="ms-3">
                <p>
                  VantageScore is a credit scoring model developed jointly by
                  the three major credit bureaus: Experian, Equifax, and
                  TransUnion. It was introduced as an alternative to the FICO
                  Score and uses a different scoring range. VantageScores range
                  from 300 to 850, just like FICO Scores.
                </p>
                <p class="mb-0">
                  <strong> Key Features of VantageScore includes: </strong>
                </p>
                <ul>
                  <li>
                    VantageScore uses similar factors as FICO Score, such as
                    payment history, credit utilization, length of credit
                    history, credit mix, and recent credit inquiries.
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    However, VantageScore may place more emphasis on trending
                    credit data, which considers recent credit behavior over
                    time.
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    VantageScore may also consider alternative data, such as
                    utility and rent payments, to assess creditworthiness for
                    individuals with limited credit histories.
                  </li>
                </ul>
              </div>
              <h5>Differences Between FICO Score and VantageScore</h5>
              <div class="ms-3">
                <p>
                  While both FICO Score and VantageScore serve the same purpose
                  of assessing creditworthiness, and they have similar scoring
                  range, there are some differences between the two models:
                </p>
                <ul>
                  <li>
                    <strong>Tri-Bureau vs. Bureau-Specific Models:</strong>
                    VantageScore creates a single tri-bureau model that can be
                    used with a credit report from Experian, Equifax or
                    TransUnion. However, FICO creates bureau-specific scoring
                    models. So, while the latest FICO Score (version 9) might
                    have one name, there are actually three slightly different
                    FICO Score 9 models, one for each of the major credit
                    reporting agencies.
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    <strong>Factors Weighting:</strong> The weight given to
                    specific credit factors may differ between the two models.
                    For example, the importance of payment history and credit
                    utilization may vary.
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    <strong>Weighting</strong>: FICO gives more weight to
                    payment history, while VantageScore's latest version
                    emphasizes total credit usage and balances.

                <strong>Other Credit Scoring Models</strong>
                <br />
                There are alternative credit scoring models developed by various
                companies and financial institutions. These models may consider
                different data sources and use unique algorithms to calculate
                credit scores.

                relevant to each specific type of loan. For example, Experian's
                FICO Auto Score, which is used for car loans, and FICO Mortgage
                Score, which is used for mortgage loans.

              <p>
                Various factors contribute to your credit score, and
                understanding them will help you take actions to improve and
                maintain a good score. Credit scores are calculated using
                various factors and weighted differently depending on the
                scoring model. The factors commonly considered in credit score
                calculations include:
              </p>
              <h5>Payment History</h5>
              <p class="ms-3">
                Your payment history is a crucial factor that heavily influences
                your credit score. Lenders want to see a track record of
                responsible credit management. Late payments, delinquencies, or
                accounts in collections can significantly impact your score
                negatively. Making consistent, on-time payments is vital for
                maintaining a good credit score.
              </p>

              <h5>Credit Utilization</h5>
              <p class="ms-3">
                Credit utilization refers to the amount of credit you're using
                compared to the total credit available to you. This ratio has a
                significant impact on your credit score. It's recommended to
                keep your credit utilization below 30% of your available credit.
                High utilization can indicate a higher credit risk and
                potentially lower your credit score.
              </p>

              <h5>Length of Credit History</h5>
              <p class="ms-3">
                The length of your credit history plays a role in determining
                your creditworthiness. Generally, a longer credit history is
                beneficial, as it provides more information for lenders to
                assess your credit behavior. This factor considers the age of
                your oldest account, the average age of all your accounts, and
                the time since your most recent activity on each account.
              </p>

              <h5>Types of Credit</h5>
              <p class="ms-3">
                The types of credit you have, such as credit cards, loans, or
                mortgages, impact your credit score. A diverse mix of credit
                accounts, including both revolving credit (like credit cards)
                and installment loans (like car loans), can positively influence
                your score.
              </p>

              <h5>New Credit Inquiries</h5>
              <p class="ms-3">
                When you apply for new credit, it generates a hard inquiry on
                your credit report. Multiple recent inquiries can indicate a
                higher credit risk. However, when you check your own credit or
                lenders perform soft inquiries for pre-approval purposes, they
                do not impact your credit score.

                Maintaining a good credit score is crucial for your financial
                well-being. Your credit score influences your ability to secure
                loans, obtain favorable interest rates, and even impacts your
                housing and employment opportunities. Regularly monitoring your
                credit score is essential for identifying potential issues and
                tracking your progress.

                Make it a habit to check your credit score regularly. Set up
                reminders to review your credit reports at least once a year or

                Typically, a SSN is required to build credit history, but
                alternative methods may be available for international students
                to establish credit without these identification numbers.
              </p>

              <p class="ms-3">
                While not as widely accepted as an SSN, some financial
                institutions may accept an ITIN to open a bank account or apply
                for a secured credit card. It's worth inquiring with different

                international students who don't have an SSN or credit history.
                These cards may have specific eligibility criteria, such as
                being enrolled in a U.S. educational institution, and they often
                have lower credit limits and higher interest rates. Applying for

                bureaus unless you have an SSN or voluntarily choose to report
                it. However, some rent reporting services allow you to report
                your rental payments, even without an SSN. These services work
                with your landlord to verify your payment history and report it
                to credit bureaus, helping you build credit based on your rental
                record.

              <p>
                A credit card is a plastic card issued by a bank or other
                financial institution. Unlike a debit card, which deducts money
                directly from your bank account when you make a purchase, a
                credit card allows you to borrow money from the card issuer up
                to a certain limit in order to buy goods or pay for services.
                <br />
                Consider a credit card as a type of loan: every time you use
                your credit card, you're borrowing money that you pledge to pay
                back. You can choose to repay the full amount borrowed at the
                end of a billing cycle, or you can carry over a balance to the
                next cycle. However, any balance that is not paid off will
                accrue interest. This is how the card issuer makes money.
                <br />
                The credit card is a powerful financial tool in the U.S.,
                allowing for convenience, fraud protection, and the ability to
                build a credit history. But it's important to remember that it
                must be used responsibly to avoid incurring debt and high
                interest charges.

                Understanding credit card use and management is crucial for
                financial well-being and responsible money handling.
                Familiarizing oneself with these key terms empowers individuals
                to make informed decisions, avoid unnecessary fees, and maintain
                a healthy credit score.

                        made within that billing cycle. It usually lasts around

              <h5>Credit Limit</h5>
              <div class="ms-3">
                <p>
                  The credit limit is the maximum amount of money that a credit
                  card issuer allows you to borrow on your credit card. It
                  represents the highest balance you can carry on the card at
                  any given time. For example, if your credit limit is $2,000,
                  you can make purchases and accumulate balances on your credit
                  card up to that amount. It's essential to manage your credit
                  card spending responsibly and stay within your credit limit to
                  avoid potential over-limit fees and negative impacts on your
                  credit score.
                </p>
              </div>
              <h5>Annual Percentage Rate (APR)</h5>
              <p class="ms-3">
                APR stands for Annual Percentage Rate, and it represents the
                interest rate charged on outstanding credit card balances if you
                do not pay your full credit card bill by the due date. It's
                expressed as an annual percentage, indicating the cost of
                borrowing money over one year. For example, if your credit card
                has an APR of 18%, it means you'll be charged 18% interest on
                any remaining balance after the grace period ends. It's crucial
                to understand your credit card's APR, as it directly impacts the
                amount of interest you'll pay if you carry a balance on your
                card.
              </p>
              <h5>Billing Cycle</h5>
              <p class="ms-3">
                A billing cycle is the specific period between two consecutive
                credit card statements. It typically lasts around 30 days and
                represents the timeframe during which you make purchases and
                incur charges using your credit card. At the end of the billing
                cycle, the credit card issuer will generate a statement that
                shows all the transactions made during that period, along with
                the total outstanding balance. The statement will also include
                the minimum payment due and the due date for making the payment.
                It's essential to keep track of your billing cycle to manage
                your credit card usage and ensure timely payments to avoid
                interest charges.
              </p>

              <h5>Statement Balance</h5>
              <p class="ms-3">
                The statement balance is the total amount you owe on your credit
                card as of the last billing cycle's closing date. It includes
                all the purchases, balance transfers, cash advances, and any
                applicable fees or interest that have been posted to your
                account during that billing cycle. The statement balance is the
                amount you are required to pay by the due date specified on your
                credit card statement to avoid any late fees or additional
                interest charges. If you pay the statement balance in full by
                the due date, you won't incur any interest on the purchases made
                during that billing cycle.
              </p>

              <h5>Grace Period</h5>
              <p class="ms-3">
                A grace period is the period of time between the end of a
                billing cycle and the payment due date on a credit card. During
                this time, you have the opportunity to pay your credit card
                balance in full without incurring any interest charges on your
                purchases. The grace period typically lasts around 21 to 25
                days, giving cardholders a window to make timely payments. To
                take advantage of the grace period and avoid interest, it's
                essential to pay the full statement balance by the due date each
                month. However, keep in mind that grace periods usually do not
                apply to cash advances and balance transfers, which may start
                accruing interest immediately.

                  <h2 class="h4">Understanding Credit Card Rewards</h2>
                </div>
              </div>
              <p>
                Rewards in the context of credit cards refer to the benefits or
                incentives that cardholders earn for using their cards to make
                purchases. They serve as incentives from credit card companies
                to encourage consumer spending. These rewards can be cash back,
                points for goods or services, or travel miles. The more a
                cardholder uses their credit card, the more rewards they
                accumulate, which can be redeemed in accordance with the card's
                specific rewards program. While beneficial, it's important to
                understand the rewards structure and responsible spending.
              </p>
              <h5>Cashback Rewards System</h5>
              <p class="ms-3">
                Rewarding mechanism that returns a percentage of the total
                amount spent on your card back to you. For instance, if a card
                offers 1% cash back on all purchases, you'll get $1 back for
                every $100 you spend.
                <br />
                However, it's important to note that cash back rewards can vary
                significantly among credit cards. Some cards offer a flat rate
                on all purchases, but many others have a tiered or bonus
                category system.
                <br />

                In a tiered system, different types of purchases earn different
                rates. For example, you might earn 3% cash back on groceries, 2%
                on gas, and 1% on all other purchases.

                <br />
                In a bonus category system, the categories that earn higher
                rates rotate periodically, typically every quarter. For
                instance, you might earn 5% on gas purchases one quarter, and
                then 5% on grocery store purchases the next quarter, with all
                other purchases earning a lower standard rate.
              </p>
              <h5>Points Rewards System</h5>
              <p class="ms-3">
                In this system, cardholders earn points for every dollar they
                spend using their credit card. The amount of points earned per
                dollar can vary based on the card's terms and conditions. For
                example, you might earn 2 points for every dollar spent on
                dining and 1 point per dollar on all other purchases.

                <br />

                These points can then be redeemed for various goods, services,
                or experiences through the credit card's reward program. Common
                redemption options include merchandise, gift cards, travel
                bookings, or even as cash back in some cases. It's important to
                note that the value of each point can differ from one card to
                another, and may also depend on what you're redeeming them for.
              </p>
              <h5>Miles Rewards System</h5>
              <p class="ms-3">
                Such systems are similar to points, but they're typically linked
                with travel-related purchases. For every dollar spent,
                cardholders earn a certain number of miles or travel points. The
                accumulation rate can vary based on categories - for instance,
                you might earn more miles for money spent on airfare or hotels.
                <br />
                These miles can then be redeemed for airfare, hotel stays, car
                rentals, and other travel-related expenses. Some credit cards
                have partnerships with specific airlines or hotel chains,
                allowing you to earn and redeem miles at a higher rate with
                those partners. Like points, the value of each mile can vary
                based on the credit card and redemption option.
              </p>

              <h5>Earning Rewards</h5>
              <p class="ms-3">
                You earn rewards based on your spending with the card. Different
                cards have different reward structures. Some cards offer a flat
                rate on all purchases, while others offer higher rates on
                certain categories of spending, like dining, groceries, or gas.
              </p>

              <h5>Redeeming Rewards</h5>
              <p class="ms-3">
                The process for redeeming rewards varies by card. You might be
                able to apply cash back directly to your credit card balance,
                deposit it into a bank account, or use it to purchase gift
                cards. Points or miles can typically be redeemed through the
                credit card company's rewards portal.
              </p>

                <strong>Understanding Terms and Conditions</strong>
                <br />
                It's very important to understand the terms and conditions of
                your credit card rewards program. Some rewards cards have annual
                fees, and the rewards you earn might not justify the cost if you
                don't use the card regularly. Additionally, some cards require
                you to redeem your rewards within a certain timeframe or they
                may expire.

              <p>
                Understanding the different types of credit cards can help you
                choose the one that best fits your needs and spending habits.
                While the features, benefits, and terms can vary greatly.
              </p>

              <h5>Student Credit Cards</h5>
              <div class="ms-3">
                <p>
                  Designed specifically for students with limited credit
                  history, making them accessible and suitable for international
                  students. These cards often have lower credit limits and may
                  offer rewards or benefits tailored to student spending habits.
                  They can be a great starting point for building credit while
                  offering some financial flexibility.
                </p>
              </div>
              <h5>Secured Credit Cards</h5>
              <div class="ms-3">
                <p>
                  Helpful for individuals with limited or poor credit history,
                  as they require a cash deposit as collateral. For
                  international students with no credit history in the U.S.,
                  secured cards provide an opportunity to establish credit by
                  demonstrating responsible card use. The cash deposit acts as
                  security for the card issuer, making it easier to obtain
                  approval.
                </p>
              </div>
              <h5>Low-Interest Credit Cards</h5>
              <div class="ms-3">
                <p>
                  Useful for students who may occasionally carry a balance, as
                  they offer lower ongoing interest rates. International
                  students who anticipate carrying a balance on their credit
                  card should consider low-interest cards to minimize interest
                  costs.
                </p>
              </div>

              <h5>Retail Credit Cards</h5>
              <div class="ms-3">
                <p>
                  May be beneficial for students who frequently shop at specific
                  retailers, as they offer rewards and discounts at those
                  stores. While retail cards can provide extra savings,
                  international students should carefully consider their
                  spending habits and ensure the rewards align with their needs.
                </p>
              </div>

              <h5>Rewards Credit Cards</h5>
              <div class="ms-3">
                <p>
                  Can be attractive for students who want to earn rewards for
                  their spending, but they should consider their specific
                  spending habits. Rewards cards may offer cashback, points, or
                  miles for eligible purchases, but students should choose one
                  that complements their lifestyle and spending patterns.
                </p>
              </div>

              <h5>Cashback Credit Cards</h5>
              <div class="ms-3">
                <p>
                  Provides straightforward cash rewards for eligible purchases,
                  which can be useful for general spending. International
                  students who prefer simplicity and cash rewards may find
                  cashback cards appealing for everyday expenses.
