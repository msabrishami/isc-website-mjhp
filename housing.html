                  <p>
                     When searching for student housing or rental properties, one of the essential steps in the process is completing a housing application. Whether applying for on-campus housing through the university or submitting an application to a private landlord or property management company for off-campus accommodations, the housing application serves as a crucial tool for both tenants and landlords to gather necessary information and assess suitability.
                  </p>
                  <p class="ms-3">The housing application typically includes several key components: </p>
                  <ul>
                     <li>
                        <strong>Personal Information: </strong>Applicants are required to provide their full name, contact details, date of birth, and sometimes a government-issued identification number. Landlords use this information for verification and communication purposes.
                     </li>
                     <li>
                        <strong>Financial Details: </strong>Applicants are asked to disclose their income source, monthly earnings, or financial aid information to assess their ability to pay rent. Landlords use this data to determine the applicant's financial stability and ability to meet rental obligations.
                     </li>
                     <li>
                        <strong>Rental History: </strong>Prospective tenants often need to provide details of their previous rental experiences, including past addresses, names of previous landlords, and contact information. This section helps landlords verify the applicant's rental history and gauge their reliability as a tenant.
                     </li>
                     <li>
                        <strong>References: </strong>Applicants may be asked to provide personal or professional references who can vouch for their character and reliability. Landlords often reach out to references to gain insights into the applicant's behavior as a tenant.
                     </li>
                     <li>
                        <strong>Additional Questions: </strong>Housing applications may include questions related to lifestyle preferences, roommate requests, or any specific requirements the applicant may have.
                     </li>
                  </ul>
                  <p>It is crucial for applicants to be truthful and accurate while filling out housing applications, as any misrepresentation of information could lead to the rejection of the application. Additionally, applicants should review and understand the terms and conditions of the lease or housing agreement before signing, as the application may serve as a precursor to the formal contract. Upon submission, landlords or housing authorities evaluate applications. Successful applicants receive an offer for housing.</p>
                  <h5>Co-Signer / Co-Sponsor</h5>
                  <p class="ms-3">Landlords often require co-signers when tenants have limited credit history, unstable income, or other risk factors. A co-signer for a lease agreement is an individual who agrees to take on financial responsibility for the lease alongside the primary tenant. Typically, a co-signer is someone with a stronger credit history or financial stability than the primary tenant, and their presence provides an added layer of security for the landlord in case the tenant is unable to meet their lease obligations, such as paying rent on time. Co-signers are legally bound to fulfill the terms of the lease, including any rent payments or damages that may arise during the lease period. It's important for co-signers to fully understand their obligations and potential liabilities before agreeing to co-sign a lease agreement. If you're unable to secure a co-signer for your lease, there are a few alternatives you can consider:</p>
                  <ul class="ms-3">
                     <li>
                        <strong>Offer a Larger Security Deposit: </strong>Some landlords might be open to the idea of accepting a larger security deposit in lieu of a co-signer. This provides them with an extra layer of financial security in case you're unable to meet your lease obligations.
                     </li>
                     <li>
                        <strong>Show Proof of Income: </strong>If you have a steady and sufficient income, you can provide documentation to demonstrate your ability to pay rent on time. This might include pay stubs, employment verification, or tax returns.
                     </li>
                     <li>
                        <strong>References and Rental History: </strong> If you have a positive rental history or good references from previous landlords, you can provide these to showcase your reliability as a tenant.
                     </li>
                     <li>
                        <strong>Roommates or Co-Tenants: </strong>Consider finding roommates or co-tenants to share the lease responsibilities. Landlords might be more willing to rent to a group with combined incomes and shared financial responsibilities.
                     </li>
                     <li>
                        <strong>Offer Prepaid Rent: </strong>Some landlords might be open to the idea of you paying several months' rent in advance, demonstrating your commitment and ability to meet your lease obligations.
                     </li>
                  </ul>

               <!-- Leasing Contract  -->
               <section id="Leasing">
                  <div class="title-lvl2">
                     <div class="outline">
                        <i class="iconify" data-icon="mdi-bank"></i>
                        <h2 class="h4">Leasing Contract</h2>
                     </div>
                  </div>
                  <p>Always ensure you have a written lease agreement. This document spells out the terms and conditions of your tenancy. Before signing, read the entire agreement. Ask questions if you don't understand any clauses. </p>
                  <h5>Length of Contract</h5>
                  <p class="ms-3">Most of the residential leasing contracts in the US are for one year. However, you can find different lengths such as six-month or 13 or 15 months lease terms or even month-to-month leases sometimes. It can be cheaper if you have a longer-term contract. Most residential places will have a refrigerator and a cooktop. Additionally, a heating system is mandatory and provided by the landlord, but most homes don't have a cooling system. However, as a tenant, you can buy a portable AC unit for your unit. Be aware that they are not very efficient for cooling and could result in a high cost of electrical bills.</p>
                  <h5>Move-in and Move-out Dates</h5>
                  <p class="ms-3">Move-in and move-out: When you move to a new place, it is important to record a video or take pictures of any damages or problems with the property and email them to the landlord. This will protect you from any future damage requests by the landlord. Additionally, when you are moving out, be sure to clean all areas of the home and record a video of the cleaned condition. This will also protect you if the landlord claims that the property was not clean after you moved out and request a cleaning fee. 
                     The other important point is if you want to move out, either because your contract is finished or your lease is month to month, you need to give (at least) one month's notice to the landlord, which doesn't need to be the start of the month.
                  </p>
                  <h5>Security Deposit </h5>
                  <p class="ms-3">In the US, landlords will usually receive an amount of money before renting the home to you. This ranges from a few hundred dollars to one or two months' rent. While most deposits are refundable, some landlords might ask for a nonrefundable deposit as well, which is mostly a marketing strategy to offer less monthly rent. When you are moving from a property, the landlord has 21 days to return your deposit. They have the right to deduct part or all of the money if you have not paid the rent, caused damage to the property, or if you have not cleaned the property when you left. Be cautious; cleaning refers not only to moving your furniture but also includes vacuuming, mopping, cleaning the refrigerator, and dusting the cabinets. If your landlord doesn't return your deposit due to some damage or other costs, and you don't agree with their decision, you can file a small claim against them. This is an easy and fast process to request your money back. As a student in court, you have a significant advantage in getting back your money if your argument makes sense to the judge.</p>
                  <h5>Renter’s Insurance</h5>
                  <p class="ms-3">Some landlords require that you get renter's insurance with a minimum coverage. The monthly fee depends on the coverage and other factors and may range from $10-20. </p>
                  <h5>Rent Control Regulations</h5>
                  <p class="ms-3">Attention to such regulations can help you find a great deal for the long term!
                     In California, based on regulations, there will be a maximum 5% increase in rent if you live in a multifamily apartment. However, some cities have their own rent control regulations, which limit rent increases to less than that. These regulations are announced to all tenants several months before the end of the year through a letter from the city. It can be a good idea to rent a home in these cities if you plan to stay in the place for several years.
                  </p>
                  <h5>Sublease </h5>
                  <p class="ms-3">In California, based on regulations, there will be a maximum 5% increase in rent if you live in a multifamily apartment.

It can be a good idea to rent a home in these cities if you plan to stay in the place for several years.</p>
                  <h5>Rent Payment Method</h5>
                  <p class="ms-3">Different landlords have different regulations for collecting rent. Some of them will ask for a monthly check, while others will ask you to set up an auto-payment. It is not recommended to pay your rent in cash, although some landlords may request it. If you set up autopay for your rent, it is better to connect your bank account to the payment system instead of using a credit card or even a debit card, as they may charge you extra in those cases. Be aware that, based on your contract, the landlord can charge you interest for late payment, and this is enforceable by law. So, be on-time to avoid penalties.</p>

                        </h2>
                     </div>
                  </div>
                  <p>It's unfortunate but important to be aware of the scams that can occur when searching for housing, especially as an international student or newcomer. Here are some common scams and ways to avoid them:</p>
                  <ul>
                     <li>
                        <strong>Advance Fee Fraud: </strong>The scammer asks for a deposit, rent payment, or administrative fee before you've met them or seen the property. 
                        Prevention: Never pay money before you see the property and sign a contract. Use secure payment methods, not wire transfers or direct deposit to an unknown account.
                     </li>
                     <li>
                        <strong>Rental Scam: </strong>The scammer advertises a property (which may not exist or be already occupied) and tries to collect a deposit or first month's rent.
                        Prevention: Always visit the property in person before agreeing to rent. Check that the person showing you the property is indeed the owner or property manager.
                     </li>
                     <li>
                        <strong>Overpayment Scam: </strong>The scammer overpays with a check or money order and asks you to wire the difference back. The original payment is fake and will bounce.
                        Prevention: Never accept overpayments, and avoid dealing with landlords who propose such schemes.
                     </li>
                     <li>
                        <strong>Identity Theft: </strong>The scammer uses the leasing process to get your personal information for identity theft. 
                        Prevention: Be careful about the information you provide. Only give your Social Security number and other sensitive personal data when you're sure it's a legitimate lease application.
                     </li>
                     <li>
                        <strong>Sublet Scams: </strong>A scammer rents a property so they can show it to you, then sublets it to multiple people and disappears with the deposits and first months' rent.
                        Prevention: Ask to see proof of their right to lease the property to you, such as a copy of their lease agreement with their landlord's contact information.
                     </li>
                  </ul>
                  <p>Here are some general tips to protect yourself: </p>
                  <ul>
                     <li>Always view the property in person before making any payments.</li>
                     <li>Be wary if the deal sounds too good to be true. If the rent is significantly below market rate, it could be a scam.</li>
                     <li>Do your homework: Look up the property and the owner's information online to verify its authenticity.</li>
                     <li>Trust your gut. If something feels off about a listing, the landlord, or the lease, it's safer to walk away.</li>
                     <li>If possible, work with a reputable rental or real estate company.</li>
                     <li>Consult with local students, university housing offices, or other reliable sources about standard practices for renting in the area.</li>
                     <li>Consider getting legal advice before signing a lease if you're unsure about it. You can also ask other students who have an experience in case you have any questions. </li>

                  <p>It's essential to understand your rights as a tenant to ensure you have a positive and secure living experience. When you rent a home in California, you have an "implied covenant of quiet enjoyment" which includes:</p>
                  <ul>
                     <li>
                        <strong>Peaceful Enjoyment: </strong>Tenants have the right to live in their rental unit without excessive noise or disturbances that significantly interfere with their ability to peacefully occupy the premises.
                     </li>
                     <li>
                        <strong>Non-Interference: </strong>Landlords must refrain from actions that disrupt or disturb the tenant's quiet enjoyment of the property. This includes entering the premises without proper notice, shutting off essential utilities, or engaging in other behaviors that interfere with the tenant's rights.
                     </li>
                     <li>
                        <strong>Habitability: </strong>The rental property should be maintained in a habitable condition, free from hazardous conditions or nuisances that would significantly impair the tenant's use and enjoyment of the premises.
                     </li>
                  </ul>
                  <p>If you believe the landlord has violated any of your rights, send them an email or text message rather than calling. Documenting the issue not only safeguards you should you end up in court, but it also informs the landlord that you're knowledgeable about the law, prompting them to be more careful about potential violations.</p>

               Utilities are the basic services required in a home to ensure a comfortable living environment. These typically include internet, electricity, gas, water, sewage, and garbage services. University housings usually provide all the utilities and include the fee in the rent, so you won’t have to worry about it, but for non-university housing options, you are responsible for the utilities. Landlords may include some utilities in the monthly rent, while others come as an additional monthly fee. Some utilities might not be provided by the complex and you need to buy them from companies (Internet and electricity is the most common ones). It's crucial for tenants to clarify with their landlords which utilities are included in the rent and which are not. Some rental agreements may include all utilities in the monthly rent payment, while others may require the tenant to set up and pay for some or all of these services separately. The cost of utilities can significantly impact the total living expenses, so it's important to factor them into your budget when considering a rental property. For the ones that you need to get separately, check the companies that provide these services and compare their rates. Ask about other student’s experiences or advice.  In the state of California, there are some special programs regarding utility bills for low-income people, which often include students. You should check those programs based on your utility provider. This can greatly decrease your monthly bill amount.              </p>
