# Basics

Identification, often simply referred to as “ID”, plays a crucial role in personal, academic, and societal contexts, especially in the United States. The primary purpose of an ID is to provide proof of who you are, ensuring that individuals can be accurately recognized and verified for various activities, ranging from opening a bank account to verifying your age.

```
It's important to understand the identification concepts for international students from Iran, as those requesting it might not know the underlying regulations.
```

In the United States, the legal necessity for an individual to provide identification is predicated on specific circumstances and the rights protected under the Constitution. Generally, private businesses can set their own policies requiring ID for service, particularly when there's a legitimate need to verify someone's identity, age, or if there's a potential financial risk involved (e.g., credit card purchases, age-restricted items). However, this isn't an absolute right; for instance, businesses can't use ID requirements as a pretext for discriminatory practices.

## Understanding Identification

It's important to note that the specific identification requirements can vary depending on:

* Federal regulations
* State laws
* Policies of individual institutions or organizations.
* Situation
* Location

Here's a breakdown of different types of identity checks and a brief description. More information for each item can be found in later sections.

```
In many instances, especially at DMV offices away from major university campuses and private businesses, officers or representatives from public/private sectors might not be well-informed about the specific documentation requirements for international students. By understanding the fundamentals of identification in the U.S., you can confidently and respectfully guide such conversations, ensuring you provide the necessary information and documentation.
```

**Basic Identification:** Verifying your age, name, or address for basic services, purchases, or entry. Some examples are:

* Buying alcohol
* Entering age-restricted venues
* Renting a hotel room

**Financial:** Opening bank accounts, applying for credit, or other financial activities. Some examples are:

* Opening a bank account
* Applying for a loan

**Driving:** Verifying you are licensed to drive.

* Being pulled over by the police, renting a car.

**Employment:** Verifying eligibility to work in the U.S., when you are applying for a job or an internship.

**Government Benefits:** Applying for benefits or government services. Such as:

* Social services
* Public assistance.

**Interaction with Law Enforcement:** Verifying identity during legal procedures or detentions.

**Air Travel:** Verifying identity for security purposes for domestic (either intrastate or interstate) or  international flights. Regulations are set by the Transportation Security Administration (TSA).

## Law Enforcement Encounters and Identification

In the United States, when a police officer has reasonable suspicion or probable cause during a law enforcement encounter, they can ask individuals for identification. This request is part of routine police procedures and may occur during various situations, such as traffic stops, pedestrian stops, or investigations into suspicious activities.

```
The Fourth Amendment of the U.S. Constitution protects citizens from unreasonable searches and seizures. This means that, generally speaking, police cannot stop an individual and demand identification without reasonable suspicion that a crime has been, is being, or is about to be committed.

The landmark Supreme Court decision in "Terry v. Ohio" (1968) established the "stop and frisk" doctrine, allowing police to briefly detain and pat-down individuals if they have a reasonable suspicion of criminal activity.
```

Some states have "stop and identify" statutes that require people to provide their name when lawfully detained by police, but even these have limits. The right not to be subjected to arbitrary ID checks by police is rooted in the principle that citizens should be free from unwarranted government intrusions unless there's a justifiable reason.

### Traffic Stops

During a traffic stop, if a police officer observes a violation of traffic laws, such as speeding or running a red light, they have the authority to request identification from the driver. The driver is typically expected to provide their driver's license, vehicle registration, and proof of insurance.

### Pedestrian Stops

In cases where law enforcement officers have reasonable suspicion that an individual may be involved in criminal activity, they can stop and question that person. In such situations, individuals may be asked to provide identification, such as a driver's license, State ID card, or other valid forms of identification.

### Investigative Stops

If law enforcement officers have probable cause to believe a crime has been committed or is in progress, they can detain individuals for investigative purposes. During such stops, individuals may be asked to provide identification, which helps officers verify their identity and any potential involvement in the situation.

### Reasonable Suspicion

Police officers may also ask for identification when they have reasonable suspicion that an individual may be involved in criminal activity, even if it does not rise to the level of probable cause. The request for identification should be based on specific and articulable facts that lead the officer to believe a crime may be occurring.

## Department of Motor Vehicles (DMV)

The California Department of Motor Vehicles (DMV) is a state agency responsible for a range of functions related to motor vehicles, drivers, and road safety. It serves as a trusted leader in providing innovative services to the public.

```

It's important to note that while the overall function and scope of services are similar across different DMVs, there can be variations in specific services and processes from state to state. If you need specific information about the services offered by a particular DMV, it's recommended to visit the official website of that DMV or contact them directly for accurate and up-to-date information.

```

### State Issued ID Cards

A state identification card is a government-issued photo ID provided by a state's agency (often the DMV or its equivalent) that serves as official proof of identity and residency for individuals who do not have or need a driver's license. It resembles a driver's license but does not grant driving privileges.

### Licensing Drivers and Registering Vehicles

One of the core functions of the DMV is to license drivers in the state of California. It is responsible for issuing driver's licenses to eligible individuals after they meet certain requirements. Additionally, the DMV registers vehicles, providing them with certificates of title and ensuring the proper ownership records are maintained.

### Securing Identities

The DMV plays a crucial role in securing identities by issuing identification cards for individuals. These cards serve as official forms of identification and are often used in various transactions and situations where identity verification is necessary.

### Regulating the Motor Vehicle Industry

The DMV is responsible for regulating various aspects of the motor vehicle industry. This includes licensing and regulating driving and traffic violator schools and their instructors, as well as vehicle manufacturers, transporters, dealers, distributors, vehicle salespeople, and dismantlers. By overseeing these entities, the DMV ensures that they adhere to regulations and standards set by the state.

### Maintaining Driving Records

The DMV maintains records of driving histories, which include information about accidents and convictions of licensed drivers. These records are used for various purposes, including assessing driving records for insurance purposes, employment background checks, and legal matters.

### Financial Responsibility Law Administration

The DMV administers the financial responsibility law, which involves ensuring that individuals have the necessary insurance coverage when operating a motor vehicle. This helps protect both drivers and others in the event of accidents or damages.

### Investigating Consumer Complaints

The DMV investigates consumer complaints related to various aspects of the motor vehicle industry, including issues with dealers, manufacturers, and other entities falling under its regulatory purview.

## International Students

This section is dedicated to the identification process and requirements for international students, specifically students on F-1 visa, for different purposes.

### Legal Status

There are several situations where international students might need to prove their legal status in the U.S. Here are some common scenarios:

* At the Port of Entry (POE)
* Employment

### Basic Identification

This identification level serves as the foundational proof of one's identity in common day-to-day situations. For basic identification purposes, you're generally verifying who you are, not necessarily your legal or immigration status, student status, or employment eligibility. Basic identification typically involves confirming facets of your identity like name, date of birth, and sometimes address or photo verification.

Some common examples include:

* Proving age when purchasing alcohol or tobacco, or gaining entrance to age-restricted events or venues.
* Collecting a parcel or mail that requires ID at a post office or delivery center.
* Renting a hotel room.

The document(s) in each item of the list below is by itself sufficient for basic identification:

* A foreign Passport: There are no further requirements such as visa, stamp, etc.  
* State issued IDs, like California ID, Driving License, or REAL ID

```
Student ID is generally not a document for basic identification as it is neither a state nor federal official document. Moreover, student ID does not show one's age.
```

### Driving

Driving on public roads in the U.S. is considered a privilege, not a constitutional or basic right. States, not the federal government, primarily handle driving regulations. This is in line with the Constitution's 10th Amendment, which delegates powers not explicitly assigned to the federal government to the states. Each state determines its own criteria for licensing drivers, although many standards are quite similar across states.

Some common scenarios that this form of identification is required are:

* Driving a car
* Renting a car
* Obtaining auto insurance

Suggested document(s) are:

* California Driver's License
* REAL ID Driver's License
* Provisional or Learner's Permit: There are specific restrictions associated with this permit, like the requirement to have an adult licensed driver in the vehicle at all times.
* Foreign license: International students may be able to drive with their foreign license in conjunction with a valid translation, i.e. International Driving Permit (IDP), for just a limited period of 10 days after establishing residency.

```
The State of California does not recognize an International Driving Permit (IDP) as a valid driver license. Please carefully review the section dedicated to this subject for more information.
```

### Banking and Financial Services

For any financial endeavors, from banking to purchasing, credible identification is paramount. It not only secures one's financial interests but also aids institutions in offering their services accurately and securely.

Some common scenarios that this form of identification is required are:

* Opening a bank account
* Renting a property
* Applying for a credit card or a loan

These sets of documents are usually required for such identifications:

* Basic identification
* Proof of income: Such as pay stubs, employment offer letters, or in the case of international students, proof of funds or financial guarantee that is usually noted on I2-0.
* Credit history: Usually SSN or ITIN
* Proof of residency: Typically a utility bill or rental agreement.

!TODO-START

### Air Travel

Purpose: Verifying identity for security purposes.

Examples: Domestic or international flights.

Accepted ID: For domestic flights, a state ID or driver's license is acceptable. For international flights, a passport and potentially a visa, depending on destination and citizenship, would be required.

### Employment

Purpose: Verifying eligibility to work in the U.S.

Examples: Applying for a job or internship.

Accepted ID: Employers will request documents as per the I-9 form requirements. This could be a combination of your passport, Form I-20 (for F-1 students), and I-94 form, or an Employment Authorization Document (EAD) if you have one.

### Government Benefits

Purpose: Applying for benefits or government services.

Examples: Social services, public assistance.

Accepted ID: The requirements can vary widely. Some may require just state ID, while others may need proof of legal status, like a visa or other documentation.

### Interaction with Law Enforcement

Purpose: Verifying identity during legal procedures or detentions.

Examples: Being detained or questioned by law enforcement or immigration officials.

Accepted ID: It's advisable for international students to carry proof of their legal status, such as a passport and a valid Form I-20, especially when traveling outside of their university's locality. A state ID alone might not be sufficient to prove legal status in the U.S.

!TODO-END

# Documents and Forms

In this section, we delve deeper into the specifics of identification documents used in the U.S.

## Form I-20

The Form I-20, officially titled the "Certificate of Eligibility for Nonimmigrant Student Status," is a government form that provides international students with proof of their acceptance into a U.S. educational institution. It is issued by the U.S. school's Designated School Official (DSO) and serves multiple purposes throughout a student's academic journey.

### Designated School Official (DSO)

A regularly-employed member of the school administration designated by the head of a Student and Exchange Visitor Program-certified school to provide recommendations to F and/or M students enrolled at the school regarding maintenance of nonimmigrant status, and to support timely and complete record keeping and reporting to the U.S. Department of Homeland Security.

### Key Details on the Form

* Student's Personal Information: This includes name, birthdate, and country of citizenship.
* School's Information: Details of the U.S. institution, including name, address, and the school's unique code.
* Program Details: Information about the student's program, such as major, level of study, and program start and end dates.
* Financial Information: Proof of financial ability to cover tuition, living expenses, and other associated costs.

```
In the case of any changes of the key information on I-20, such as change of major, program end date in case of renewal, etc., a new form should be issued by the school's DSO.
```

### Use Case  

The Form I-20 is a vital document for international students, but it's important to understand its role and how it relates to other crucial documents.

* Visa Application
* U.S. Entry
* Maintaining Status
* Employment and Training

### Updates, Changes, and Renewal

The I-20 will need updating if there are significant changes, such as a switch in majors, extensions, or transfers. Always consult with the DSO before making any significant changes to one's academic situation.

The I-20 is valid for the duration of a student's academic program. However, if students switch programs, transfer schools, or extend their study duration, they'll receive a new I-20. If the I-20 expires while a student is still in their program, they must request a renewal through their DSO. An expired I-20 while in the U.S. can lead to a loss of legal student status.

Students may receive a new Form I-20 from their DSO in the following circumstances:

* If the physical copy of the form is destroyed or misplaced.
* For travel endorsement.
* When the student’s SEVIS status changes (e.g., from Initial to Active).
* For any substantive change to student information, such as changes to a student’s personal information, program of study, OPT, etc.

## Form I-94

The I-94 is the Arrival and Departure Record issued by U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP) to foreign visitors entering the U.S. It primarily serves as evidence that a traveler has been legally admitted to the U.S. The form indicates the date of arrival, the type of visa, and the date by which the individual must depart the U.S.

```
The I-94 isn't typically used as a primary form of identification like a passport or driver's license. However, it's a critical document that verifies an individual's immigration status in the U.S. and might be requested in scenarios requiring validation of an individual's legal status in the country.
```

### Importance and Use Cases

Every foreign visitor to the U.S., including international students, needs the I-94 to demonstrate both the legality and the terms of their entry. It effectively marks the duration of their permissible stay in the country. The use cases for this form include:

* Employment Verification: For international students on optional practical training (OPT) or seeking employment, the I-94 is often required to confirm legal status.
* Driver's License Application: Some states might request the I-94 during the application process for a driver's license.
* Extension of stay or change of status

### Relationship with I-20 and Visa

The I-94, I-20, and the visa (often F-1 for students) together form a trifecta of crucial documents for international students. While the visa allows entry into the U.S., the I-20 certifies enrollment in a recognized institution, and the I-94 validates legal entry and the duration of the authorized stay.

For students, the I-94 will generally align with the duration of the study program as indicated on the I-20 form, typically marked as "D/S" (Duration of Status), which means they can stay in the U.S. as long as they maintain their student status.

For those on a single entrance visa, the I-94 remains crucial. If one departs the U.S., their current I-94 typically expires. To re-enter the country, they would need a new visa and subsequently a new I-94 upon re-entry.

### Accessing the Form I-94

The I-94 form, traditionally a paper document given to international travelers upon their arrival in the U.S., underwent a significant change in April 2013. U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP) began automating the I-94 in an effort to streamline the entry process. Today, the I-94 form is primarily electronic for air and sea travelers.

You can receive a free and online copy of your I-94 by visiting the <a href="https://i94.cbp.dhs.gov/I94/#/home">official CBP I-94 website</a>.

## Student Visa Stamp

A U.S. student visa stamp is a physical visa placed in your passport by a U.S. embassy or consulate. It signifies that you have been approved to travel to the U.S. port-of-entry and request permission from the U.S. immigration officer to enter the country for a specific purpose, in this case, as an international student.

### Single vs Multiple Entry

The single entry visa allows the visa holder to enter the U.S. only once. If you leave the U.S., you'll need to apply for a new visa to return, unless your departure and return fall within a short period, and certain conditions apply.

The multiple entry visa allows the holder to enter the U.S. multiple times until the visa's expiration date. This means you can leave and return to the U.S. without needing to reapply for a new visa, provided the visa is still valid.

### Visa vs. Status

The student visa is the physical stamp in your passport. It determines your eligibility to travel to the U.S. and seek entry. However, it doesn’t grant you the right to enter or remain in the U.S.

Once you’re admitted to the U.S., you obtain a specific status (e.g., F-1 for international students). Your status defines the terms and conditions of your stay in the U.S. Your Form I-20 (for F-1 students) and the I-94 record are documents that evidence your status and permitted length of stay.

### Use Cases

The U.S. student visa stamp's primary purpose is for entry into the United States. It doesn’t guarantee admission, but it allows you to travel to a U.S. port-of-entry and request permission to enter.

```
Once you're inside the U.S., your visa stamp's expiration date or its number of entries doesn't impact your ability to remain in the U.S. This is dictated by your status, evidenced by your I-20 form and I-94 record.
```

While the visa stamp is primarily for entry, its presence and details serve as a valuable record and confirmation of a few other items:

* Lawful entry
* Intent upon arrival
* Cross-verification with Other Documents

However, for many situations, especially those involving legal status or authorization (like work or benefits eligibility), the visa stamp is just one of several documents that entities may request to get a comprehensive understanding of a foreign national's status and eligibility.

## Iranian Passport

A passport, whether U.S. or foreign, is also a valid form of identification to a level. For international students, a passport is usually the primary form of identification. However, a foreign passport is not a document validating one’s legal stay in the United States.

While Iran does not have an embassy in the United States due to diplomatic relations being severed since 1980, Iranian nationals can still access essential consular services, including passport renewals. This is facilitated through the "<a href="https://daftar.org/">Interests Section of the Islamic Republic of Iran</a>," located within the Embassy of Pakistan in Washington, D.C. This office handles matters related to Iranian passports and offers other consular services for Iranian citizens in the U.S.

## Permanent Resident Card (Green Card)

A Green Card, officially known as a Permanent Resident Card, also known as Resident Alien Card, is a U.S. government-issued identification card that signifies your status as a lawful permanent resident (LPR) of the United States. It grants you the right to live and work in the U.S. indefinitely.

### Types of Green Card

* **Family-Sponsored Green Cards**: Obtained through family relationships with U.S. citizens or permanent residents.
* **Employment-Based Green Cards**: Obtained through employment or investment in the United States.
* **Refugee/Asylee Green Cards**: Issued to refugees and asylees after being granted asylum or refugee status.
* **Diversity Visa (DV) Lottery Green Cards**: Granted to individuals selected through the DV lottery program.
* **Special Immigrant Green Cards**: Reserved for individuals with unique qualifications or circumstances, such as religious workers, certain foreign nationals serving in the U.S. military, and others.

## International Driving Permit

An International Driving Permit (IDP) or International Driver's License is a document that accompanies your home country's driver's license and provides translations of your license into multiple languages. This makes it easier for officials in other countries to interpret your license.

```
An International Driving Permit (IDP) is not a standalone license but serves to help officials in other countries interpret your original license and only serves as a translation.
```

### Validity and Duration

California acknowledges valid IDPs, but only in conjunction with a valid foreign driver's license. You can't drive with just an IDP. Your home country's driver's license remains the primary proof of your driving eligibility.

The State of California does not recognize an International Driving Permit (IDP) as a valid driver license. California does recognize a valid driver license that is issued by a foreign jurisdiction (country, state, territory) of which the license holder is a resident. The IDP is only a translation of information contained on a person's foreign driver license and is not required to operate a motor vehicle in California.

### Tourists vs Students

Tourists or short-term visitors can use their IDP and foreign driver's license to drive in California for up to one year from their entry date. However, once you establish residency in California (for example, by enrolling in a school, securing employment, or renting a long-term home), you are typically required to get a California driver's license within 10 days.

```

Once you establish residency in California (such as when you start school, rent a long-term home, or get a job), you are generally required to obtain a California driver's license. Typically, you have 10 days to apply for a California driver's license.

```

## California ID Card

For those who do not drive, California offers a State Identification Card through the Department of Motor Vehicles (DMV). It serves a similar function to a driver's license, minus the driving privileges.

### Application Process

It is important to check the latest requirements and appointment schedule system through <a href="https://www.dmv.ca.gov/">DMV’s website</a>.

* Complete a Driver’s License (DL) or ID Card Application.
* Visit a DMV Office: Schedule an appointment online for faster service.
* Verify your identity with an acceptable identity document. Your current name needs to match the name on the identity document (I-20, I-94 card, and passport).
* Provide your social security number (SSN), if applicable.
* Present acceptable residency documents (if you have never had a California DL/ID card).
* Pay the nonrefundable application fee (see below for information about reduced- and no-fee ID cards).
* Have your thumbprint scanned.
* Have your photo taken.

You will receive your new ID card via mail within three to four weeks. If you have not received your new ID card after 60 days, visit <a href="https://www.dmv.ca.gov/portal/driver-licenses-identification-cards/drivers-license-id-card-status/">Driver’s License & ID Card Status</a>.

## Real ID

A REAL ID is a driver’s license or identification card that is also a federally accepted form of identification. REAL ID cards are marked with a golden bear and a star. You are not able to solely apply for a Real ID. When applying for an Identification card or Drivers License, the Real ID will also be on the card. If you see a star on the card, you have a Real ID.

The Real ID Act establishes minimum security standards for state-issued driver's licenses and ID cards. Real ID-compliant cards are required for certain federal purposes, such as boarding domestic flights or entering federal buildings. To obtain a Real ID-compliant State ID card, you will need to provide additional documentation, typically including proof of identity, residency, Social Security Number, and lawful presence in the United States.

If you want to apply for a REAL ID, you must also provide proof of your identity, SSN, and two proofs of residency from the list of acceptable REAL ID documents.

## Driving License

A California Driver's License is considered a primary form of identification. It includes a photo, signature, and important identifying information such as your name, address, and date of birth. More information can be found in the Transportation section.

### Application Process

The application process is similar to the California ID Card application process with some differences. To obtain a California driver's license, you must meet specific age and eligibility requirements. For example, you generally need to be at least 16 years old to apply for a regular Class C driver's license, pass written and driving tests, and provide documentation proving your legal presence in the United States. In addition to the documents required for an ID card, obtaining a driver's license involves additional requirements, such as passing vision and knowledge tests, as well as a behind-the-wheel driving test.

```

You can take the written test in Farsi, if needed.

```

After passing the written test, you'll receive an interim ID card that you can use while waiting for the permanent one. A California driver's license allows you to legally drive a motor vehicle within the state. It can also be used as an identification document.

# Financial Identification

The SSN (Social Security Number) and ITIN (Individual Taxpayer Identification Number) are pivotal identification tools in the U.S., primarily serving financial and tax-related purposes. Both numbers are integral for tracking income, ensuring tax compliance, and facilitating interactions with various governmental agencies.

## Social Security Number (SSN)

The Social Security Number, commonly abbreviated as SSN, stands as one of the fundamental identifiers for individuals residing in the United States. Originally devised to keep track of individual earnings for the purpose of the Social Security program, its significance has expanded vastly over the years. In today's interconnected society, the SSN acts not merely as a number, but as a key, unlocking various aspects of American life.

At its core, the SSN is a nine-digit number issued to U.S. citizens, permanent residents, and temporary working residents. Its primary role was, and continues to be, to monitor citizens' earnings over their lifetimes. The Social Security Administration uses these records to calculate Social Security benefits upon retirement, disability, or in the event of death, for dependents.

### Importance and Use Cases

The SSN's role has grown beyond its initial purpose. Now, it serves as a crucial identifier for multiple facets of life, from opening a bank account, applying for a job, to renting an apartment or setting up utility services:

* Applying for a credit card
* Applying for loans
* Financing an auto-mobil
* Filing taxes
* Some housing applications for financial background checks

### Eligibility

The Social Security Number (SSN) isn't just for U.S. citizens. Various categories of individuals are eligible, depending on their status and purpose of stay in the country. Anyone who works in the U.S. must have an SSN for wage reporting purposes and to pay taxes.

* While many interactions in the U.S. may ask for an SSN, it's not mandatory for everyone to have one.
* Individuals who want to avail certain government services or benefits might be required to have an SSN.
* While not mandatory, having an SSN can make various processes (like opening a bank account) more straightforward.

```
Anyone who works in the U.S. must have an SSN for wage reporting purposes and to pay taxes beside their residency status, i.e. being a U.S. citizen, green card holders, lawful permanent residents, International students on F-1  if they are authorized to work in the U.S., etc.
```

International students (F-1 status) should apply for a SSN when:

* They have been authorized to work in the U.S., either on or off campus,
* They have evidence of work authorization, such as an on-campus job offer, or approval for Curricular Practical Training (CPT), Optional Practical Training (OPT) or off-campus employment through economic hardship.

The international students who don’t have a job, either on campus or off campus, e.g. self-funded master students, cannot apply for a SSN. For various financial reasons, it is recommended to get SSN as soon as possible to build their credit history. For these students, It is suggested to find a simple on-campus job, such as being a grader, library staff, etc. to be eligible for SSN.

```
An SSN marked "Not Valid for Employment" is issued for specific non-work purposes and cannot be used for employment or obtaining work authorization.
```

### Privacy Concerns

It's important to keep your SSN confidential. It should not be given out unless absolutely necessary, as it can be used in identity theft. More information can be found on the <a href="https://www.ssa.gov/scam/">Social Security Administration website</a>. Some examples are:

* Scammers pretend to be from an agency or organization you know to gain your trust.
* Scammers say there is a problem or a prize.
* Scammers pressure you to act immediately.
* Scammers tell you to pay in a specific way.

### Application Process

Students can apply for a SSN at their local Social Security office. It's important to remember that an application cannot be filed until at least ten days have passed since entering the U.S.

### Required Documents

* Verification of immigration status
* Work eligibility
* Identification

These identifications usually include documents like:

* A valid passport
* I-20 or DS-2019 form
* I-94 Arrival/Departure
* Record, and evidence of employment eligibility

### Social Security Administration Letter from employer

* Make copies of the required documents (job offer, which should be issued by the department you work for, or a document which shows that you have an on-campus job, your I-20, your F-1 Visa, and I-94).
* Hand them in to the International Students Office (OIS).
* They will instruct you to collect a letter for the Social Security Administration in a couple of days.

### Visiting a Local Social Security Office

Take the letter issued by OIS along with your passport, I-94, and I-20 to the social security office which you are referred to by OIS. The address of this social security office is mentioned on the top of the letter. Fill out the required forms, and wait for the card to get delivered in mail. Since you will receive the card in mail, it is more secure to provide a reliable mailing address**.**

## Individual Taxpayer Identification Number (ITIN)

An Individual Taxpayer Identification Number (ITIN) is a nine-digit tax processing number issued by the Internal Revenue Service (IRS). It is specifically for individuals who do not have and are not eligible for an SSN but have federal tax reporting or filing obligations, e.g., If you are awarded a fellowship. ITINs do not confer legal immigration status or work authorization.

```

ITIN is issued by the IRS, and is designed for tax-processing purposes for those who aren't eligible for an SSN, such as certain non-resident aliens. On the other hand, SSN is issued by the Social Security Administration to serve  as an identifier for individuals for Social Security purposes.

### Importance and Use Case

ITINs are not intended for work authorization. They are solely for tax reporting and filing purposes. If you require authorization to work in the U.S., you need to pursue the appropriate work visa or employment authorization.

* **Tax Filing:** ITINs enable individuals without an SSN to fulfill their federal tax obligations. This includes filing federal income tax returns, paying taxes, and complying with U.S. tax laws.
* **Legal Requirements:** Some individuals, such as non-resident aliens or dependents of U.S. citizens or residents, may need an ITIN to meet legal tax requirements, report income, claim tax treaty benefits, or apply for certain tax credits.
* **Tax Withholding:** If you are earning income in the U.S. as a non-resident, having an ITIN ensures proper tax withholding from your paychecks. Without an ITIN or SSN, you may be subject to higher tax withholding rates.
* **Claiming Tax Benefits:** ITINs are required to claim certain tax benefits, such as the Child Tax Credit or the American Opportunity Credit. These credits can significantly reduce an individual's tax liability.

### Application Process

To obtain an ITIN, individuals must complete Form W-7, Application for IRS Individual Taxpayer Identification Number, and submit it to the IRS. Along with the form, applicants must provide supporting documentation that verifies their identity and tax status. Schools usually assist students with their application.

### Credit Report/Card with ITIN

While it's not a replacement for an SSN, the ITIN allows individuals to comply with U.S. tax laws and provides a means to process and account for tax returns and payments. However, some banks and credit card issuers do allow individuals to apply for a credit card using an ITIN.

If you obtain a credit card using an ITIN, your credit activity can also be reported to the major credit bureaus, just as with an SSN. This means that responsibly managing a credit card obtained with an ITIN can help you build a credit history in the U.S. However, not all lenders or credit issuers may accept ITINs or report credit activity associated with them. It's crucial to check with the specific financial institution about their policies regarding ITINs and credit reporting.

### Building Credit History with ITIN

If you've been building credit with an ITIN and then later obtain an SSN, it's important to proactively ensure that your credit history is linked to your new SSN. The credit bureaus don't automatically merge the histories associated with an ITIN and an SSN, even though they belong to the same individual.

Here are steps you can take to help link your credit histories:

* **Contact the Credit Bureaus:** Inform Equifax, Experian, and TransUnion of your new SSN, requesting the transfer of your ITIN credit history to your SSN.
* **Notify Your Creditors:** Update your existing creditors about your SSN, ensuring future credit activity is reported under it.
* **Monitor Your Credit:** Regularly check your credit reports to verify that your history correctly appears under your SSN.
* **Pause New Credit Applications:** Hold off on new credit applications for a short period, allowing time for records to update.
