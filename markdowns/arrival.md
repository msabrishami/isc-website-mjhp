This chapter helps those who had obtained their visa and are planning to travel to the U.S. navigate the details of starting their journey.

```
**A message from your friends at Iranian Students of California:** We understand that the process of obtaining a visa and entrance to a the U.S. can be a confusing and frustrating process, specially for the students with Iranian citizenship pursuing their dreams. We are here for you. Providing a structured and reliable source of information is the least we can do. 
```

In this section, we introduce different steps starting your departure to the U.S., and describe necessary information, including a basic introduction of the government agencies that you will face in this process.

## Basic Itinerary

Issuing visa to international students at a U.S. embassy or consulate to their travel to the United States is managed by the U.S. Department of State. However an entrance visa **is not a guarantee** of admission to entrace to the United States.

The responsibility for admitting individuals into the United States falls under the Department of Homeland Security (DHS). Specifically, within the DHS, the U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP) is the agency tasked with inspecting and admitting or denying entry to individuals at the border and Ports of Entry (POE). You can find more detailed information about each of these agencies and their specific regulations in the following sections.

```
Based on the United States law (Homeland Security Act of 2002), obtaining a U.S. visa does not guarantee admission of enterance into the United States. 
```

Moreover, the U.S. has restricted customs regulations to control the flow of goods entering into the United States, including food and agricultural products, medications, etc. Your knowledge about such regulations helps you prepare your suitcase! Dont’ be worried, there are no restrictions on lavashak!

Finally, there are different official forms that are either required to be filled by you upon your arrival, or are provided to you after your arrival. You can find more information about each of these important documents in this section.

```
**Know Your Rights:** It is essential to know your rights if approached by immigration officials, whether at the border, an airport, or within the U.S. You have the right to be treated fairly, and in specific situations, you might have the right to legal representation or to decline answering certain questions without a lawyer present. We strongly suggest our international NewComers to read the corresponding section on our information portal.

## Department of Homeland Security (DHS)

The Department of Homeland Security, commonly known as DHS, was established in 2002 to help keep the United States safe. Its main job is to protect the country from potential dangers whether it is guarding the country's borders, checking travelers at airports, or responding to natural disasters. DHS also plays a key role in making sure the U.S. is protected against terrorism threats.

### Primary Roles and Responsibilities

The creation and responsibilities of the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) primarily stem from the Homeland Security Act of 2002. This Act was signed into law after the attacks on September 11, 2001, as part of an effort to reorganize and improve the country's ability to prevent and respond to threats of terrorism.

* **Border Security**
* **Immigration and Customs:** Authority in overseeing legal immigration, managing visa stay lengths, and addressing illegal immigration. Role in customs and admitting individuals and goods into the U.S.
* **Cybersecurity**
* **Disaster Relief and Preparedness**
* **Counterterrorism**

```
While the Department of State has the authority to issue visas, the responsibility for admitting individuals into the United States falls under the DHS. Specifically, within DHS, CBP is the agency tasked with inspecting and admitting or denying entry to individuals at the border and ports of entry.
```

### Interactions and Key Points for Newcomers

The Department of Homeland Security (DHS) plays a significant role in a newcomer's journey to and stay within the United States. Here's what you should know:

**Arrival at U.S. Ports (CBP):** When you first arrive in the U.S., you'll likely encounter officers from U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP), a key agency under DHS. They inspect and decide who gets to enter the country.

**Visa vs. Admission (CBP):** Being granted a visa by the U.S. Department of State does not guarantee entry into the U.S. The final decision rests with CBP officers at the port of entry. Think of a visa as a request to knock on the U.S.'s door, and CBP decides whether to let you in.

**Staying Legally (ICE):** It's crucial to adhere to the conditions of your visa. Overstaying or violating visa terms can lead to complications, and you might have interactions with U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE), another DHS agency.

**Changing or Extending Status (USCIS):** If you wish to change your visa type or extend your stay, you'll deal with U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS), also under DHS. Always ensure you understand and follow the right processes.

**Airport Security (TSA):** If you're flying within the U.S., you'll interact with the Transportation Security Administration (TSA), which handles airport security. Be prepared for security checks and understand the guidelines on what you can carry.

### DHS Key Agencies

The Department of Homeland Security (DHS) oversees several agencies, each with specialized roles in ensuring the safety and security of the United States:

* **Customs and Border Protection (CBP):** Role in inspecting and admitting/denying individuals at ports of entry.
* **U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE):** Enforcement of immigration and customs laws within the U.S.
* **Transportation Security Administration (TSA):** Responsible for security in American airports and other transportation systems.
* **U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS):** Manages legal immigration, including processing citizenship, green card, and visa applications.

## Customs and Border Protection (CBP)

U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP), an agency within the U.S. Department of Homeland Security (DHS), controls the flow of goods and people into the United States to prevent unlawful, high-risk, and improperly documented travelers and goods (food, agriculture items, etc.) from entering the U.S. CBP’s work focuses at the borders of the United States, including airports, land borders and seaports.

### Primary Roles and Responsibilities

CBP's main duties are outlined in the Homeland Security Act of 2002 and related laws. Here is a brief summary:

* **Border Security:** CBP patrols thousands of miles of U.S. borders with Canada and Mexico, as well as coastal areas, to prevent illegal crossings and smuggling.
* **Inspections at Ports of Entry:** CBP officers inspect travelers and goods at airports, sea ports, and border crossings to ensure compliance with U.S. laws.
* **Facilitation of Legitimate Trade and Travel:** While CBP plays a key security role, it also facilitates billions in legitimate trade and millions of legal travelers each year.
* **Agriculture Protection:** CBP helps to prevent the introduction of harmful pests and foreign diseases through inspections and regulations.

### Interactions and Key Points for Newcomers

When arriving in the U.S., CBP officers are often the first officials you'll encounter, setting the tone for your entry experience:

* **Entry Process:** Upon arrival in the U.S., travelers are subject to inspection by CBP officers. They verify travel documents, ask about the purpose of your visit, and sometimes inspect belongings.
* **Visa vs. Admission:** As previously mentioned, holding a visa doesn't guarantee entry. CBP officers at the port of entry make the final decision on your admission.
* **Customs Declarations:** If you're arriving from overseas, you'll likely need to fill out a customs declaration form, which asks about items you're bringing into the U.S.
* **Duty-Free Allowance:** Be aware of what you can bring into the U.S. without paying duties, and declare items above the duty-free allowance.
* **Restricted and Prohibited Items:** Certain items, like some foods, plants, and animal products, are restricted or prohibited. Check these in advance to avoid complications.

## Port of Entry (POE)

A Port of Entry, often referred to as a POE, is any designated place where a person or goods may legally enter a country. In the United States, these includes:

* International airports
* Road and rail crossings on a land border
* Major seaports

Whether you're arriving by plane, ship, or car, it's at a POE where U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP) officers will inspect travelers and their belongings, ensuring compliance with immigration, customs, and agriculture regulations.

The complete list of the POEs can be found on <a href="https://www.cbp.gov/about/contact/ports">CBP’s website</a>. There are more than 20 POEs in California. Some of the famous ones are:

* Los Angeles International Airport-Cargo Operations (LAX), California - 2720
* San Diego (SAN International Airport), California - 2501
* San Jose International Airport (SJC), California - 2834
* San Francisco International Airport (SFO), California - 2801
* San Ysidro (in San Diego, US and Mexico land border crossing), California - 2504
* Los Angeles/Long Beach Seaport, California - 2704
* Ontario Airport (ONT), California - 2721

## Form I-94: Arrival/Departure Record

Form I-94, also known as the “Arrival/Departure Record,” is an important document for non-U.S. citizens entering the United States. The I-94 form is issued by CBP to non-U.S. citizens when they enter the U.S. This form simply records:

* Date of arrival
* Visa status (like F-1 for student visas or B-2 for tourist visas),
* The date by which the individual must depart the U.S.

**I-94 vs. Entrance Visa:** While the visa allows a person to travel to the U.S., the I-94 record determines how long they are authorized to stay.

**Importance:** The I-94 is a crucial document that proves the legal status of a non-U.S. citizen in the U.S. It's important to keep this document safe, and to be aware of the departure date listed.

**Electronic Record:** As of 2013, the I-94 is generally issued electronically upon arrival by air or sea. Travelers can access and print their electronic I-94 record from the <a href="https://i94.cbp.dhs.gov/">CBP website</a>.

**Paper Form:** If entering by land, or in some special circumstances, a paper I-94 card may be issued, which is usually stapled into the passport.

**Admission Number:** The I-94 includes an 11-digit admission number, which is used for various purposes such as completing the I-9 Employment Eligibility Verification form or applying for immigration benefits.

**Departure Date:** The departure date on the I-94 is the last day a person is authorized to stay in the U.S. Staying beyond this date could lead to serious immigration consequences.

**Extension or Change of Status:** If a person wishes to stay in the U.S. beyond the departure date on their I-94, or if they wish to change their status (like from a tourist to a student), they generally must apply with U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS) before the departure date on the I-94.

# Customs

When international students or other travelers arrive in the United States, their luggage and personal belongings are subject to the U.S. customs process. This procedure ensures that items brought into the country align with regulations and that no prohibited or restricted goods enter unintentionally.

For many international students, this is their first introduction to the U.S. legal system. They learn the importance of declaring certain items, understanding what is permitted, and respecting quantities allowed for various products. From souvenirs and gifts to personal items and foods, everything in one's luggage is under the purview of customs regulations.

```
Customs regulations are dynamic and frequently updated, so it's crucial to stay informed about the most recent changes to ensure smooth travel experiences.
```

## Importance

Many travelers, especially international students, may wonder why there are so many rules and regulations surrounding what they can bring into the U.S. in their luggage. It's more than just administrative formalities; these regulations are designed with specific and vital purposes in mind. Here is a more detailed topics of why customs is important:

**Protection of U.S. Ecosystem:** One of the primary reasons for stringent customs rules, especially regarding food and agricultural items, is the protection of the U.S. ecosystem. Items like plants, seeds, and certain foods can carry invasive species, pests, or diseases that could be harmful to local agriculture or the environment. An invasive species introduced accidentally can disrupt the local ecosystem, leading to environmental and economic damages. By regulating what travelers can bring, the U.S. seeks to prevent such unintended consequences.

**Cultural and Legal Sensitivities:** Some personal items might have cultural, historical, or legal sensitivities. This is why objects like certain antiques or artifacts might be subject to scrutiny. It's a way to ensure that cultural heritage is respected and that items of significant value or importance are not taken out of or brought into the country without proper documentation.

**Safety and Legal Protection:** Beyond environmental or cultural concerns, the customs process is designed to protect travelers and the wider U.S. community. Prohibited items, whether they are certain drugs, weapons, or other contraband, are restricted to ensure public safety. By understanding and complying with these rules, students ensure they don't unintentionally put themselves in legal jeopardy.

## Process at the POE

All items you bring should be declared to the U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP) upon arrival. Each individual arriving into the United States must complete the Customs and Border Protection (CBP) Declaration Form 6059B. This form can now be filled out prior to or during your travel.

```
It is always better to declare something if you are unsure. Failure to declare can result in penalties.
```

### Declaration Form 6059B

Upon your arrival, you'll be required to declare any items you're bringing into the U.S. This typically involves completing a customs declaration form, even if you don't have any items to declare.

Form 6059B Customs Declaration

### Preclearance at Selected International Airports

At some international airports, the US operates United States border preclearance stations ([link](https://www.cbp.gov/travel/preclearance)), where CBP’s check is done before boarding the international flight. These airports include:

* Abu Dhabi International Airport, Abu Dhabi, United Arab Emirates
* Many international airports in Canada

## CBP’s Regulations

Customs regulations are dynamic and frequently updated, so it's crucial to stay informed about the most recent changes to ensure smooth travel experiences. The list of prohibited items can be found on <a href="https://www.cbp.gov/travel/us-citizens/know-before-you-go/prohibited-and-restricted-items">CBP’s website</a>. Here are the main categories of prohibited items that are most relevant to international students:

### Food and Agricultural Products

All agriculture items must be declared and are subject to inspection by a CBP Agriculture Specialist at ports of entry to ensure they are free of plant pests and foreign animal diseases. Prohibited or restricted items may include meats, fresh fruits and vegetables, plants, seeds, soil and products made from animal or plant materials.  

However, undeclared prohibited agriculture items will be confiscated and can result in the issuance of a civil penalty to the traveler for failure to declare the prohibited item.

### Money

You are allowed to bring unlimited amounts of money into the U.S., but you must declare amounts exceeding $10,000. This can be in the form of cash, checks, money orders, or negotiable instruments. Failure to declare could result in seizure of the money by U.S. Customs.

### Medications

You can bring prescription and non-prescription medicines for personal use, but there are rules. Medications should be in their original containers with labels, and a prescription may be required. Narcotic drugs may have additional restrictions.

### Knnown Prohibited Items

Some items are prohibited such as drugs, drug paraphernalia, certain fruits, vegetables, meats, certain animal products, and products made from protected species. In addition, firearms and dangerous weapons are generally prohibited. Some special items for Iranians are listed below:

* Limoo A’maani
* Golpar
* Nuts
* Rice

# Entrance Permission

When an official at a U.S. embassy or consulate issues an individual a visa prior to their travel to the United States (managed by the U.S. Department of State), there is no guarantee that CBP will admit them into the United States. The visa is permission to apply to enter the United States at a port of entry. A CBP officer will then use the inspection and examination to determine whether individuals can enter the United States when they arrive.

## Inspection by CPB

CBP must examine anyone, including F (academic) and M (vocational) students, who arrive from outside the United States and want to enter the United States. This includes:

* Form I-94, “Arrival-Departure Record”
* Form 6059, “Customs Declaration”

The first person you will meet when arriving by air is a CBP officer at a primary inspection booth. This CBP officer will conduct a primary inspection. To assist the CBP officer in conducting this primary inspection, please present all your documents and forms, including:

* Passport
* Visa
* Form I-20
* Any other proof of admission to your school that you have and any other documentation necessary to establish your admissibility as an F or M student in the United States

The CBP officer will ask you questions to determine several pieces of information:

* The purpose of your visit to the United States
* How long you plan to visit
* Where you will be staying
* If you have the means to support yourself financially in the United States
* If the documents you are presenting are compatible with the purpose and intent of your visit
* CBP officers also will examine your luggage and personal effects to determine if you have any prohibited or restricted items.

Once the CBP officer determines you can enter the United States as an F or M student, the office will register you in US VISIT and stamp your passport and issue your Form I-94. Just a note that starting in 2013, I-94 is issued electronically.

### Secondary Inspection

If CBP cannot complete your inspection at the primary inspection booth, the CBP officer will refer you for a secondary inspection. The secondary inspection is a more detailed examination of your admissibility and your personal effects.

If you have any question regarding the CBP inspection process, you may ask to talk to a supervisory officer at any time during processing. You may also ask to talk to a CBP passenger service manager.

## Late Arrival

Typically, F-1 students are permitted to arrive in the U.S. up to 30 days prior to the start date listed on their Form I-20. They are expected to report to their school by that start date. If for some legitimate reasons (e.g., visa delays, health issues, family emergencies) a student is unable to arrive at their U.S. school by the program's start date, they might require a **"late arrival letter"** or some other form of documentation or permission from the school.

```
Late arrival letter is simply a letter from your school/department informing the CBP officer that the school itself is fine with your late arrival and you will not face critical issues to start your semester. 
```

Entry to the U.S. after the program start date is not guaranteed and is at the discretion of the CBP officer at the POE as well as the student’s academic department or school. Students who are not able to enter the U.S. by the program start date on the I-20/DS-2019 must contact their academic department to request a late arrival permission letter. Students may be asked for the late entry permission letter at the U.S. Port of Entry.
