# Introduction

Before we delve into the details, it is essential to comprehend the concept of tuition. In the United States, tuition refers to the price you pay for instruction at a university or college. This can be a substantial cost, especially for international students, but there are numerous sources of financial aid available that can help you manage these expenses.

Financial aid refers to various forms of monetary assistance provided to individuals, typically students, to help them cover the costs associated with education. These costs can include tuition, fees, textbooks, housing, meals, and other educational expenses. Financial aid aims to make education more accessible and affordable, especially for those who might not have the means to fully cover these expenses on their own.

The financial aid can take several forms, such as grants, scholarships, work-study, or loans.

## Understanding the Key Terms

### Free Application for Federal Student Aid (FAFSA)

Free Application for Federal Student Aid. A form used to apply for federal and sometimes state financial aid.

### Expected Family Contribution (EFC)

The Expected Family Contribution (EFC) is a crucial factor in the financial aid process for college or university. It is a calculated amount that represents how much a student and their family are expected to contribute towards their education expenses for a specific academic year. The EFC is determined by the information provided in the FAFSA. It affects financial aid eligibility.

### Satisfactory Academic Progress (SAP)

To continue receiving federal financial aid, students must maintain satisfactory academic progress, which often includes meeting GPA and completion rate requirements.

### Cost of Attendance (COA)

The total estimated cost of attending a college or university, including tuition, fees, room, board, books, and other expenses.

## Grant

A grant is a type of financial aid provided to students, individuals, organizations, or projects with the purpose of supporting their education, research, or specific initiatives. Grants are funds that are typically awarded based on specific criteria, such as financial need, academic achievement, research goals, or other qualifying factors. Unlike loans, grants do not need to be repaid, making them a valuable source of financial assistance.

### Pell grant

The Pell Grant is a federal need-based grant provided by the U.S. Department of Education to eligible undergraduate students pursuing their first bachelor's degree. It is one of the largest sources of federal financial aid for students with limited financial resources. The amount of the Pell Grant varies based on the student's financial need, cost of attendance at the chosen institution, and enrollment status (full-time or part-time). The Pell Grant does not require repayment and is intended to help low-income students afford higher education.

### Cal Grant

The Cal Grant is a type of financial aid program specific to the state of California. It provides need-based grants to California residents pursuing higher education in California colleges, universities, and career technical schools. There are several types of Cal Grants, including the Cal Grant A, Cal Grant B, and Cal Grant C. Each type of Cal Grant has its own eligibility requirements and award amounts.

* **Cal Grant A:** This grant is intended for students pursuing academic and career-oriented programs. It covers tuition and fees at public colleges and provides a stipend for educational expenses.
* **Cal Grant B:** Cal Grant B provides a living allowance and additional funds for low-income students. It assists with tuition and fees and includes a stipend for educational costs.
* **Cal Grant C:** This grant is focused on vocational or technical education programs. It helps cover education and training costs.

### University Grant

A University Grant is a type of financial aid provided directly by colleges or universities to their students. Unlike federal grants that come from the government, university grants are institution-specific and are funded by the college or university itself. University grants can be need-based or merit-based, and their eligibility criteria and award amounts vary from institution to institution. These grants are often intended to bridge the gap between the cost of attendance and other financial aid sources, making education more affordable for students attending that specific school.

### Need-Based Grants

Need-based grants are awarded to individuals or students who demonstrate a significant financial need based on their family's income, assets, and other financial circumstances. These grants are designed to make education more accessible to those who may not have the means to cover educational expenses.

### Merit-Based Grants

Merit-based grants are awarded to individuals who have demonstrated exceptional academic achievements, talents, skills, or accomplishments in specific areas such as academics, sports, arts, community service, or leadership. These grants are often a recognition of a person's outstanding abilities and contributions.

### Project Grants

Project grants are provided to organizations, researchers, or individuals working on specific projects or initiatives that align with the goals and priorities of the grant provider. These grants may support research, community development, arts, sciences, and other projects that contribute to societal progress.

### Institutional Grants

Some colleges and universities offer institutional grants to their students. These grants are often based on financial need but can also include merit-based components. Institutional grants are intended to make education more affordable for students attending a specific institution.

## Scholarship

A scholarship is a financial award given to individuals to help them pursue their education or further their skills in a particular area. Scholarships are typically provided by educational institutions, private organizations, foundations, corporations, government agencies, and individuals. They are awarded based on various criteria, which can include academic excellence, talents, achievements, leadership skills, community involvement, field of study, and financial need.

### PhD Fellowship

Some PhD programs offer “Fellowship” to their selected candidates. The recipient of fellowship is not required to do Research Assistantship (RA) or Teaching Assistantship (TA) to be paid. This award is considered as a scholarship and therefore such students are not considered to be employed by the University. Most schools offer conditional fellowships, which means the recipient should address criterias, such as a minimum GPA, so their fellowship remains valid.

## Loans

A loan is a borrowed sum of money that is provided by a lender to a borrower with the understanding that the borrower will repay the borrowed amount along with interest over a specified period. Loans are a common way for individuals, businesses, and organizations to finance various expenses, including education, home purchases, business ventures, and more. Unlike grants or scholarships, loans need to be repaid according to the terms and conditions agreed upon.

### Federal

Federal loans are loans offered by the U.S. Department of Education through various programs to help students and their families finance education. These loans often have more favorable terms and repayment options compared to private loans. The three main types of federal loans are:

* **Subsidized:** These loans are need-based and available to undergraduate students. The government pays the interest while the borrower is in school, during the six-month grace period after leaving school, and during authorized deferment periods. Subsidized loans help reduce the overall cost of borrowing.
* **Unsubsidized:** These loans are available to both undergraduate and graduate students, regardless of financial need. Interest starts accruing from the time the loan is disbursed, even while the borrower is in school. Students have the option to pay the interest while in school or defer it, which leads to interest capitalization (adding the accrued interest to the principal balance).
* PLUS: Parent PLUS loans are available to parents of dependent undergraduate students, and Graduate PLUS loans are available to graduate and professional students. These loans have higher interest rates and allow borrowing up to the cost of attendance minus other financial aid received.

### Private (Internationals)

Private loans, also known as alternative loans, are offered by private lenders such as banks, credit unions, and online financial institutions. These loans are not backed by the federal government, and their terms vary widely based on the lender. Private loans may be used for educational expenses but often come with higher interest rates and less favorable repayment options compared to federal loans. Eligibility for private loans depends on the borrower's creditworthiness, and a co-signer is sometimes required, especially for students with limited credit history.

## Work Study

A work-study program is a form of financial aid that provides students with part-time employment opportunities, often on campus, to help them earn money to cover educational expenses. Work-study programs are available in many colleges and universities as part of their financial aid packages. These programs aim to offer students practical work experience while helping them offset the costs of their education.

Once awarded work-study, students can explore job openings offered by their institution. These jobs can range from administrative roles to positions in academic departments, libraries, student services, research projects, and more. On-campus positions are common, but some schools may also have off-campus work-study opportunities with community organizations or local businesses.

Students typically work part-time hours, usually around 10 to 20 hours per week. The number of hours may be limited to ensure that students can balance their work-study job with their academic responsibilities. Earnings are paid directly to the student in the form of a paycheck.

Work-study positions often pay at least the federal minimum wage, but some jobs might offer higher wages depending on the type of work and the skills required. Institutions usually understand that academics are a priority, so they often work with students to create flexible schedules that accommodate their class schedules and academic commitments.

### Employment Based Payment

It is important to understand that teaching assistantship (TAship), research assistantship (RAship), grader, or mentorship positions are not considered as financial aids. Students are paid for such positions. For more information, please refer to the section related to working regulations for students.

Language proficiency (e.g., English proficiency for international students) and specific requirements for international applicants may also play a role.

# Application Process

Navigating university financial aid can be daunting, yet it is pivotal to making higher education accessible. This chapter offers a step-by-step guide, emphasizing the importance of details and deadlines in securing funds effectively.

## FAFSA

### Gather Required Documents and Information

Before you start, gather the necessary documents and information:

* Social Security Number (SSN) or Alien Registration Number (if not a U.S. citizen)
* Federal Income Tax Returns (yours and your parents', if dependent)
* Records of untaxed income (e.g., child support, interest income)
* Bank statements and records of investments
* FSA ID (created on the Federal Student Aid website)

### Create an FSA ID

You will fill out the FAFSA online, and in order to sign in you will need an FSA ID.

You will need an Federal Student Aid (FSA) ID and so will one parent. This ID will serve as your electronic signature and grant access to FAFSA online.

It can take a few days for your FSA ID to become active, so I recommend doing this before you are actually filling out your FAFSA.

### Start the FAFSA Application

To get started filling out the FAFSA, head over to the <a href="https://studentaid.gov/h/apply-for-aid/fafsa">FAFSA website</a> to get started. On the login page, click “I am the student” and then you will be asked to enter your FSA ID username and password. The following describes the pages you’ll see as you go through the FAFSA and how to complete them.

### Choose the Correct Year

This is slightly tricky and a common mistake when student’s fill out the FAFSA! You are applying for financial aid for NEXT school year, so make sure to select the following year, not the current one. For example, if you are filling out the FAFSA in the Fall of 2023, you will fill out the 2024-25 FAFSA (not the 23-24 FAFSA).

### Personal Information

In this section, you answer basic information about yourself. This page is extremely important because if you make a mistake on your name, birthdate or social security number it’s very hard to fix later.

Make sure you enter your social security number exactly right and that your name matches your social security card exactly. This is your legal name and the one you need to use to fill out the FAFSA.

Next it will ask for your email, phone number and address. Those will probably fill automatically from your FSA ID log in.

The next page covers your state of residency (answer how long you have lived there) and your citizenship status. FAFSA is for US Citizens and eligible non citizens.

The next section covers your education and your education plans. It asks what your high school completion status will be the next school year (select high school graduate, GED or homeschool) as well as what degree you’ll be working on. For this, select “1st Bachelor’s degree“.

If you’re a high school student or continuing college student, you will not have completed a bachelor’s degree (four year degree) by the next school year so answer no to this question.

```
Important Note: If you are a high school senior starting college next year, you will select "first year, never attended college" EVEN IF you did running start or another program where you earned college credit as a high school student.
```

Say “yes” to being considered for work study because you want to have all possible options available to you! You do NOT have to take a work study job if you say yes to this question.

Note that if you are male, you are required to register for the selective service. You can register within the FAFSA application but it does not affect your eligibility for money for college. Registering for the selective service is NOT joining the military. It is registering for the draft, which is required by law for males. The last time the draft was used to bring people into the military was in 1972.

The student demographics section of FAFSA wraps up with asking you for your driver’s license number (leave blank if you don’t have one), if you’ve been in foster care and the highest level of education completed by your parent or parents.

### Dependency Status

This section asks a series of questions that determine if you are a dependent or independent student.

For most high school and college students the answer here is YES. The system in the United States is based on parents paying for college even if the student is over 18 and most students are dependent, which means they will provide parent information. You will need to do this even if your parents will not be paying for college. Their income will still determine your eligibility for different types of financial aid.

You are an independent student if any of the following apply to you:

* You are 24 years old or older
* You are active duty in the military or are a veteran
* Are married
* Have a child who you are supporting
* Have a legal guardian
* Have been in foster care since you were 13
* Are homeless

Keep in mind that if you are under 24 and any of these situations apply to you, colleges will ask for documentation that proves that situation applies to you, so make sure to gather those documents now so you are ready to provide them when asked (you will not need them to fill out FAFSA, but you will need them later). You will not be able to receive financial aid without providing this documentation.

Based on your answers, if you ARE an independent student, you will not see the next set of questions about parents. If you are a dependent student, then you WILL see questions about your parents which you will need to answer.

### Parental Information (Dependent Students)

You only see these questions if you are dependent.

The first question is about your parent/parents ' marital status. If you have a single parent, you will only answer questions about that parent. If your parents are married, or the parent who provides the most financial support to you is married to a step parent, you will provide information about both parents.

If you have undocumented parents, enter all zeros for your parent’s social security number.

You will then answer questions about your parents state of residence and household size. Note that it’s possible the household size will be different from what your parents report on taxes. That’s totally ok when you fill out the FAFSA.

For their financial information, The first question is if your parents have filed taxes for the previous year. Then, you may have the option to securely transfer tax information from the IRS to the FAFSA. This is called “IRS data retrieval”. If you have this option, definitely take it! It makes sure that you can’t make a mistake entering information and it also makes it less likely that you’ll need to provide additional documentation to your colleges. If possible, use the IRS Data Retrieval tool, this makes the FAFSA go faster and requires less verification later. If you don’t see this button or have this option, it’s no big deal, you can enter it manually.

If your parents are undocumented you will not be able to do IRS data retrieval, even if your parents pay taxes with an ITIN. You also will not be able to use it if your parents information including their address does not exactly match their tax forms.

When asked what programs your parents or family members receive, again, if you don’t know what it is, you probably don’t have it. If you do have it, then click the box. If your parents are undocumented you will not see these questions for them because they are federal social programs. The three pages have a lot of questions about various income related things that might or might not apply to you. In general, if your parents don't know what it is, they probably don’t have it.

The last page of this section has three questions dealing with your parents bank accounts and investments. For the balance of checking and savings accounts, an estimate is fine. Most people don’t have a consistent amount of money in their accounts and that’s totally fine. An estimate is fine.

For real estate investments, do not include the value of your parents home if they own it. This is where you include other real estate or money (called assets) that your parents own, if any. If they don’t have any assets, just leave it with a zero. Similarly, for the final question about business, this does not apply to most small family owned businesses with less than 100 employees.

### School Selection

This part of filling out the FAFSA starts with the name, city and state of your high school. Click “search” and then click on the result that matches your high school.

Next, you’ll select the colleges you’d like to have your FAFSA sent to. You do not need to know their code, you can just enter the information in the boxes and it will bring up options for you to select (similar to what you did for your high school).

```
Important Note: Send the FAFSA to every college you are considering applying to, including two year colleges and trade or technical schools. You can enter up to 10 schools. If you are applying to more than 10, after your FAFSA is processed and sent to colleges you can go back in and change some of them to get them all. DO NOT WAIT until you have applied or been accepted! 
```

For housing plans, I always recommend choosing that you plan to live on campus. This is because it makes you eligible for the most aid and it’s good to keep your options open! It’s much easier to later decide to live at home than it is to later decide to live on campus. If you are 100% sure that you are going to be living at home (and you can commute to all the colleges you are applying to) then it’s fine to say “with parents” or “off campus”. If there is any chance you might live on campus make sure to select that.

### Dependency Overrides (If Applicable)

If you believe you have special circumstances that warrant a dependency override, explain your situation. This is reviewed by the school's financial aid office.

### Student Financial Information

This section is questions about the student’s finances. Most high school students do not earn enough money to pay taxes (though some do) so if you haven’t paid taxes and don’t have your own bank account that’s no problem. Just put zeros for any questions that don’t apply to you.

Only include information here for accounts that are in your name. Similar to parent financial information, if there are things that you don’t know what they are, you probably don’t have them. Make sure to check the box for free and reduced lunch if you receive that at school.

In the child support box, remember that this is for you the student. If your parent receives child support for you, they will enter that in the parent information. You would only enter it here if you, the student, are receiving child support for your own child that you are supporting.

```
Household Information: Provide information about the size of your household and the number of family members attending college.
```

### Sign and Submit

The next page gives you the opportunity to review and print everything you’ve entered. You can always go back and change anything you need to fix. Make sure to take a moment to look it over before going to the next page. The next page is where you agree to the terms. Click agree and next.

Now you’re ready to sign! You will sign along with one parent.

You will electronically sign and then your parents will. If your parent is unable to get a PIN to sign, you can also print a signature page and mail it in. This takes longer to process, but works just fine. Parents who are undocumented or green card holders will have to print and mail the signature page. Make sure not to miss this step!

```
Reminder: The deadline for FAFSA application is March 2nd (California). 
```

### Post Submission Steps

**Confirmation:** After submitting, you'll receive a confirmation page and email. Review the information for accuracy.

**Corrections (if needed):** If you need to make corrections or updates, you can log back into your FAFSA account and make changes.

**Review Student Aid Report (SAR):** Within a few days to a few weeks, you'll receive a Student Aid Report (SAR) via email. Review it for accuracy.

**Review Financial Aid Offers:** Once your FAFSA is processed, colleges and universities you applied to will use the information to determine your financial aid eligibility. Review the financial aid offers from each school.


**Private Scholarships:** First you need to search for scholarships that align with your field of study, interests, achievements, or personal characteristics. Use scholarship search engines, college websites, community organizations, and professional associations. You can follow these steps:

**Create a List:** Compile a list of scholarships you're eligible for, noting their deadlines, requirements, and application materials.

**Gather Materials:** Collect necessary documents, such as transcripts, recommendation letters, essays, and any other supporting materials required by the scholarships.

**Write Essays:** Craft thoughtful and tailored essays that address the specific prompts or themes of each scholarship. Highlight your accomplishments, aspirations, and how you fit the scholarship criteria.

**Request Recommendations:** Reach out to teachers, mentors, or employers for recommendation letters. Provide them with information about the scholarship and your accomplishments.

**Complete Applications:** Fill out applications for each scholarship with accurate and relevant information. Pay close attention to instructions and guidelines.

**Proofread:** Carefully review your application for errors, typos, and consistency. Ensure all required materials are included.


**Submit Applications:** Submit your scholarship applications before the deadlines. Keep track of submission confirmations.


**Follow Up:** Some scholarships may require interviews or additional steps after the initial application. Be prepared for any follow-up communication.

## Private Loans

First you need to research private lenders that offer student loans. Compare interest rates, repayment terms, and benefits.

### Application Process

**Check Eligibility:** Review the eligibility criteria for each lender, including credit score requirements, enrollment status, and other factors.

**Gather Information:** Prepare your personal and financial information, including Social Security number, income details, and employment information.

**Choose a Co-Signer (if needed):** Private lenders often require a co-signer, especially if you have limited credit history or income. Choose someone with a strong credit history.


**Apply Online:** Fill out the loan application on the lender's website. Provide accurate and complete information.


**Credit Check:** Most private lenders will conduct a credit check to assess your creditworthiness and determine the loan terms.


**Review Terms:** Carefully review the loan terms, including interest rates, repayment plans, and any fees.


### Post Application Process


**Accept Loan Offer:** If approved, review and accept the loan offer. Make sure you understand the terms and obligations.
**Complete Promissory Note:** Sign the loan's promissory note, a legal document outlining the terms and conditions of the loan.

**School Certification:** The lender may require your school to certify your enrollment and the loan amount. This process varies by lender.

**Receive Funds:** Once the loan is approved and certified, the lender will disburse the funds to your school. The school deducts any applicable fees and applies the remaining funds to your tuition and other educational expenses.
