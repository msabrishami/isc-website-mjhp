# Housing

Finding suitable student housing and rentals is an essential aspect of a successful college experience in the United States. With thousands of educational institutions across the country, both domestic and international students are constantly in search of safe, comfortable, and affordable housing options. This overview aims to guide students through the process of finding the right accommodation, highlighting essential factors, tips, and resources to make the search efficient and effective.

## Types of Housing

* **On-Campus Housing:** Many universities offer on-campus dormitories and residential halls, providing convenience and easy access to campus facilities and events.
* **Off-Campus Apartments:** Renting an apartment off-campus provides more independence and often more amenities, but students may need to commute to campus.
* **Shared Housing:** Many students opt to share apartments or houses with roommates to split the rent and living costs.
* **Homestays:** Some students may prefer living with host families to immerse themselves in the local culture.

## Factors to Consider

This section covers any additional tips, resources, and draws attention to factors that are important to choosing the right housing.

* **Budget:** Determine your budget and search for housing options that fit within your financial limits.
* **Lease Terms:** Carefully read and understand the lease agreement, including rental duration, responsibilities, security deposit, sublease clauses, and potential penalties.
* **Location:** Consider proximity to campus, public transportation, and amenities such as grocery stores, restaurants, and recreational facilities.
* **Safety:** Prioritize safety and research crime rates and safety measures in the potential neighborhood. There is safety information available on Google for each neighborhood.
* **Roommates:** If sharing accommodation, choose roommates with similar living habits and preferences.
* **Single or Family:** Many university housings provide a separate building for families. If you are choosing an off campus housing, make sure you understand the regulations related to housing for families with children.
* **Amenities:** Laundry facilities
* **Commute:** Make sure you have a plan to commute to campus.
* **Others** (including payment method, utility bills, etc.)

## Search for Housing

There are different methods for finding a rental home. Ask other students about any available student groups that share rental opportunities. If the property manager is a company or you are renting a home in a large complex, you can often find reviews about them on Yelp or other websites, such as their entry in google maps, which can be helpful in choosing the right place. Always ask other students if they have experience as well.

### University Housing Offices

Check with your university's housing office for on-campus options and assistance with off-campus housing.

* On-campus housing: University-provided housing for students on campus, mostly for undergraduate students.
* Off-campus housing managed by the university: Complexes owned and operated by the university housing service for students.

### Online Rental Platforms

Utilize websites and apps like Zillow, Trulia, Apartments.com, or Rent.com to find rental listings.

### Social Media and Student Forums

Join university-specific groups or Iranian student groups on Facebook or other social media platforms to find potential roommates and available housing. Ads on these websites cannot be completely trusted.

* <a href="https://craigslist.com/">Craigslist</a>
* Facebook groups

Be aware that there is a high chance of scams on this website.

### Local Community Boards

Check local newspapers and community boards (e.g., Nextdoor) for rental listings and sublet opportunities.

### University Housing Platforms

Some Universities have a website to help their own students in finding roommates and housing. Make sure to check for that on your University’s website.

## Housing Application

When searching for student housing or rental properties, one of the essential steps in the process is completing a housing application. Whether applying for on-campus housing through the university or submitting an application to a private landlord or property management company for off-campus accommodations, the housing application serves as a crucial tool for both tenants and landlords to gather necessary information and assess suitability.

The housing application typically includes several key components:

* **Personal Information:** Applicants are required to provide their full name, contact details, date of birth, and sometimes a government-issued identification number. Landlords use this information for verification and communication purposes.
* **Financial Details:** Applicants are asked to disclose their income source, monthly earnings, or financial aid information to assess their ability to pay rent. Landlords use this data to determine the applicant's financial stability and ability to meet rental obligations.
* **Rental History:** Prospective tenants often need to provide details of their previous rental experiences, including past addresses, names of previous landlords, and contact information. This section helps landlords verify the applicant's rental history and gauge their reliability as a tenant.
* **References:** Applicants may be asked to provide personal or professional references who can vouch for their character and reliability. Landlords often reach out to references to gain insights into the applicant's behavior as a tenant.
* **Additional Questions:** Housing applications may include questions related to lifestyle preferences, roommate requests, or any specific requirements the applicant may have.

It is crucial for applicants to be truthful and accurate while filling out housing applications, as any misrepresentation of information could lead to the rejection of the application. Additionally, applicants should review and understand the terms and conditions of the lease or housing agreement before signing, as the application may serve as a precursor to the formal contract. Upon submission, landlords or housing authorities evaluate applications. Successful applicants receive an offer for housing.

### Co-Signer / Co-Sponsor

Landlords often require co-signers when tenants have limited credit history, unstable income, or other risk factors. A co-signer for a lease agreement is an individual who agrees to take on financial responsibility for the lease alongside the primary tenant. Typically, a co-signer is someone with a stronger credit history or financial stability than the primary tenant, and their presence provides an added layer of security for the landlord in case the tenant is unable to meet their lease obligations, such as paying rent on time. Co-signers are legally bound to fulfill the terms of the lease, including any rent payments or damages that may arise during the lease period. It's important for co-signers to fully understand their obligations and potential liabilities before agreeing to co-sign a lease agreement. If you're unable to secure a co-signer for your lease, there are a few alternatives you can consider:

* **Offer a Larger Security Deposit:** Some landlords might be open to the idea of accepting a larger security deposit in lieu of a co-signer. This provides them with an extra layer of financial security in case you're unable to meet your lease obligations.
* **Show Proof of Income:** If you have a steady and sufficient income, you can provide documentation to demonstrate your ability to pay rent on time. This might include pay stubs, employment verification, or tax returns.
* **References and Rental History:** If you have a positive rental history or good references from previous landlords, you can provide these to showcase your reliability as a tenant.
* **Roommates or Co-Tenants:** Consider finding roommates or co-tenants to share the lease responsibilities. Landlords might be more willing to rent to a group with combined incomes and shared financial responsibilities.
* **Offer Prepaid Rent:**Some landlords might be open to the idea of you paying several months' rent in advance, demonstrating your commitment and ability to meet your lease obligations.

## Leasing Contract

Always ensure you have a written lease agreement. This document spells out the terms and conditions of your tenancy. Before signing, read the entire agreement. Ask questions if you don't understand any clauses.

### Length of Contract

Most of the residential leasing contracts in the US are for one year. However, you can find different lengths such as six-month or 13 or 15 months lease terms or even month-to-month leases sometimes. It can be cheaper if you have a longer-term contract. Most residential places will have a refrigerator and a cooktop. Additionally, a heating system is mandatory and provided by the landlord, but most homes don't have a cooling system. However, as a tenant, you can buy a portable AC unit for your unit. Be aware that they are not very efficient for cooling and could result in a high cost of electrical bills.

### Move-in and Move-out Dates

Move-in and move-out: When you move to a new place, it is important to record a video or take pictures of any damages or problems with the property and email them to the landlord. This will protect you from any future damage requests by the landlord. Additionally, when you are moving out, be sure to clean all areas of the home and record a video of the cleaned condition. This will also protect you if the landlord claims that the property was not clean after you moved out and request a cleaning fee.

The other important point is if you want to move out, either because your contract is finished or your lease is month to month, you need to give (at least) one month's notice to the landlord, which doesn't need to be the start of the month.

### Security Deposit

In the US, landlords will usually receive an amount of money before renting the home to you. This ranges from a few hundred dollars to one or two months' rent. While most deposits are refundable, some landlords might ask for a nonrefundable deposit as well, which is mostly a marketing strategy to offer less monthly rent. When you are moving from a property, the landlord has 21 days to return your deposit. They have the right to deduct part or all of the money if you have not paid the rent, caused damage to the property, or if you have not cleaned the property when you left. Be cautious; cleaning refers not only to moving your furniture but also includes vacuuming, mopping, cleaning the refrigerator, and dusting the cabinets. If your landlord doesn't return your deposit due to some damage or other costs, and you don't agree with their decision, you can file a small claim against them. This is an easy and fast process to request your money back. As a student in court, you have a significant advantage in getting back your money if your argument makes sense to the judge.

### Renter’s Insurance

Some landlords require that you get renter's insurance with a minimum coverage. The monthly fee depends on the coverage and other factors and may range from $10-20.

### Rent Control Regulations

Attention to such regulations can help you find a great deal for the long term!

In California, based on regulations, there will be a maximum 5% increase in rent if you live in a multifamily apartment. However, some cities have their own rent control regulations, which limit rent increases to less than that. These regulations are announced to all tenants several months before the end of the year through a letter from the city. It can be a good idea to rent a home in these cities if you plan to stay in the place for several years.

### Sublease

In California, based on regulations, there will be a maximum 5% increase in rent if you live in a multifamily apartment. However, some cities have their own rent control regulations, which limit rent increases to less than that. These regulations are announced to all tenants several months before the end of the year through a letter from the city. It can be a good idea to rent a home in these cities if you plan to stay in the place for several years.

### Rent Payment Method

Different landlords have different regulations for collecting rent. Some of them will ask for a monthly check, while others will ask you to set up an auto-payment. It is not recommended to pay your rent in cash, although some landlords may request it. If you set up autopay for your rent, it is better to connect your bank account to the payment system instead of using a credit card or even a debit card, as they may charge you extra in those cases. Be aware that, based on your contract, the landlord can charge you interest for late payment, and this is enforceable by law. So, be on-time to avoid penalties.

## Housing Scams

It's unfortunate but important to be aware of the scams that can occur when searching for housing, especially as an international student or newcomer. Here are some common scams and ways to avoid them:

### Advance Fee Fraud

The scammer asks for a deposit, rent payment, or administrative fee before you've met them or seen the property.

**Prevention:** Never pay money before you see the property and sign a contract. Use secure payment methods, not wire transfers or direct deposit to an unknown account.

### Rental Scam

The scammer advertises a property (which may not exist or be already occupied) and tries to collect a deposit or first month's rent.

**Prevention:** Always visit the property in person before agreeing to rent. Check that the person showing you the property is indeed the owner or property manager.

### Overpayment Scam

The scammer overpays with a check or money order and asks you to wire the difference back. The original payment is fake and will bounce.

**Prevention:** Never accept overpayments, and avoid dealing with landlords who propose such schemes.

### Identity Theft

The scammer uses the leasing process to get your personal information for identity theft.

**Prevention:** Be careful about the information you provide. Only give your Social Security number and other sensitive personal data when you're sure it's a legitimate lease application.

### Sublet Scams

A scammer rents a property so they can show it to you, then sublets it to multiple people and disappears with the deposits and first months' rent.

**Prevention:** Ask to see proof of their right to lease the property to you, such as a copy of their lease agreement with their landlord's contact information.

### General Tips to Avoid Housing Scams

Here are some general tips to protect yourself:

* Always view the property in person before making any payments.
* Be wary if the deal sounds too good to be true. If the rent is significantly below market rate, it could be a scam.
* Do your homework: Look up the property and the owner's information online to verify its authenticity.
* Trust your gut. If something feels off about a listing, the landlord, or the lease, it's safer to walk away.
* If possible, work with a reputable rental or real estate company.
* Consult with local students, university housing offices, or other reliable sources about standard practices for renting in the area.
* Consider getting legal advice before signing a lease if you're unsure about it. You can also ask other students who have an experience in case you have any questions.

## Tenants' Rights

It's essential to understand your rights as a tenant to ensure you have a positive and secure living experience. When you rent a home in California, you have an "implied covenant of quiet enjoyment" which includes:

* **Peaceful Enjoyment:** Tenants have the right to live in their rental unit without excessive noise or disturbances that significantly interfere with their ability to peacefully occupy the premises.
* **Non-Interference:** Landlords must refrain from actions that disrupt or disturb the tenant's quiet enjoyment of the property. This includes entering the premises without proper notice, shutting off essential utilities, or engaging in other behaviors that interfere with the tenant's rights.
* **Habitability:**The rental property should be maintained in a habitable condition, free from hazardous conditions or nuisances that would significantly impair the tenant's use and enjoyment of the premises.

If you believe the landlord has violated any of your rights, send them an email or text message rather than calling. Documenting the issue not only safeguards you should you end up in court, but it also informs the landlord that you're knowledgeable about the law, prompting them to be more careful about potential violations.

# Utility

Utilities refer to basic services that are essential for the daily functioning of households. These services include electricity, water, sewerage, gas, trash collection, and digital services like internet and cable TV. They are typically provided by companies or public agencies and are billed either monthly or quarterly based on usage or a flat rate.

While on-campus housing often includes utilities in the rent, students living off-campus are typically responsible for setting up and managing their own utility services. This involves understanding:

* Which utilities you need to pay for and which might be included in your rent.
* How to set up these services when you first move in.
* Managing monthly payments to avoid service interruptions.
* Knowing your rights and responsibilities as a utility consumer.

## Utilities and Lease Contract

Landlords may include some utilities in the monthly rent, while others come as an additional monthly fee. Some utilities might not be provided by the complex and you need to buy them from companies (Internet and electricity is the most common ones). It's crucial for tenants to clarify with their landlords which utilities are included in the rent and which are not. Some rental agreements may include all utilities in the monthly rent payment, while others may require the tenant to set up and pay for some or all of these services separately.

The cost of utilities can significantly impact the total living expenses, so it's important to factor them into your budget when considering a rental property. For the ones that you need to get separately, check the companies that provide these services and compare their rates. Ask about other student’s experiences or advice.  

## Special Offers

In the state of California, there are some special programs regarding utility bills for low-income people, which often include students. You should check those programs based on your utility provider. This can greatly decrease your monthly bill amount.

### California Alternative Rates for Energy (CARE) Program

The CARE program is an initiative in California designed to support low-income households by providing significant monthly discounts on their energy bills. Administered by several utilities across the state, including:

* Pacific Gas and Electric (PG&E)
* Southern California Edison
* San Diego Gas & Electric

The program aims to ensure that essential energy services remain affordable for everyone. Eligibility for the CARE program is determined based on the household size and total annual income, or if the household participates in certain public assistance programs. By reducing the financial burden of energy costs, the CARE program plays a vital role in enhancing the quality of life for many Californians.

## Electricity

California is serviced by several major electricity providers, including Pacific Gas and Electric (PG&E), Southern California Edison, and San Diego Gas & Electric. The state is also known for its commitment to green energy, so many areas receive power from renewable sources.

## Water and Sewer

Water services in California vary by municipality. Due to periodic drought conditions in the state, water conservation is vital. Students should be aware of any local water usage restrictions. Sewer services, responsible for wastewater removal, are usually combined with water services on a single bill.

## Gas

Natural gas is a common energy source for cooking and heating in many California homes. Pacific Gas and Electric (PG&E) is a major provider, but several local agencies also deliver gas services. Students should ensure they have carbon monoxide detectors installed if their housing uses gas appliances.

## Trash and Recycling

Waste management services are typically provided by the municipality or by private companies. It's essential to be aware of the local recycling regulations, as California is keen on promoting recycling and reducing landfill waste. Some areas might also offer composting services.

## Internet and Cable TV

California is home to various internet service providers ranging from big names like Comcast and AT&T to local providers. Students can choose from several types of connections, including fiber-optic, DSL, and cable. Many students opt for bundling their internet and cable TV services for cost savings, though with the rise of streaming services, some may choose to forgo traditional cable.
