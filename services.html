            Grasping U.S. phone service terminology is vital, as the system and terms may differ significantly from
            those in other countries. Some of these terms are:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li><strong>Phone Number:</strong> In the U.S., phone numbers typically have 10 digits: a three-digit area
              code, followed by a
              seven-digit number (e.g., +1-123-456-7890).
            </li>

            <li><strong>Data:</strong> This refers to internet usage on your mobile device.</li>

            <li><strong>International Roaming:</strong> This is when your phone uses another carrier's network to
              maintain service when
              you're traveling outside of your provider's coverage area. Usually comes with a cost depending on the plan
              you have.
            </li>

            <li><strong>Mobile Hotspot/Tethering:</strong> This is when you use your smartphone as a portable Wi-Fi
              hotspot to share your
              phone's data connection with other devices, such as your laptop or tablet.
            </li>

            <li><strong>Mobile Carriers:</strong> Major carriers include AT&T, Verizon, T-Mobile, Sprint (now part of
              T-Mobile), and
              recently
              Google Fi.
            </li>

            <li><strong>Mobile Plan:</strong> There are numerous plans within each of the mobile carriers. See below and
              specific Mobile
              Carrier’s website for more detailed information about each of these plans.
            </li>
          </ul>

          <h5>Phone Number</h5>
          <p class="ms-3">
            In the U.S. and Canada, the parts of a phone number are the <strong>exit code</strong>, <strong>country
            code</strong>, <strong>area code</strong>, <strong>telephone prefix</strong>, and <strong>line
            number</strong>. The exit code lets you dial out of your home country. The
            country code is an
            identifier for a specific country. The area code directs calls to a broad region. The telephone prefix is
            a
            smaller area within that region, like a city. The line number identifies the specific phone you are trying
            to reach.
          </p>

          <!-- ======= Note ======= -->
          <div class="alert alert-primary" role="alert">
            <h5>Canada:</h5>
            <p>
              It is important to note that although the country code of Canada is the same as the US, calling Canada is
              considered an international call. Some plans support free calls to Canada but not all of them. So, be
              cautious about calling Canada. In cases where you were charged on accident, communicate that with your
              carrier’s customer service and they may waive the fee.

          <h5>Writing a Phone Number</h5>
          <p class="ms-3">
            How to write a phone number? In the United States, phone numbers are typically written in the following
            format: (XXX) XXX-XXXX, where "XXX" represents the area code and "XXXX" represents the local number. Here's
            an example: (123) 456-7890. Please note that the parentheses around the area code are optional, but they are
            commonly used for clarity.

            The US has several mobile carriers (wireless communications service providers) offering different plans and
            services. Major carriers include <strong>AT&T</strong>, <strong>Verizon</strong>, <strong>T-Mobile</strong>,
            <strong>Sprint</strong> (now part of T-Mobile), and recently <strong>Google
            Fi</strong>. Additionally, there are numerous <strong>Mobile Virtual Network Operators (MVNOs)</strong> that
            operate on these major
            networks and often offer more affordable plans.The websites to each of these carriers are:

              mobile services under its brand name using the network of a licensed mobile operator.

            In general, there are different types of mobile plans based on the method of the contracts, e.g. prepaid,
            postpaid, and family plans.
          </p>

          <h5>Prepaid</h5>

          <p class="ms-3">
            Pay for your service upfront. Once you've used your data, call minutes, and texts, you'll need to purchase
            more. Great for budgeting and avoiding unexpected costs. No long-term commitment required.
          </p>

          <p class="ms-3">
            Prepaid plans can be a good option for new international students, or travelers. These plans typically do
            not
            require a long-term contract or credit history. They offer flexibility and control over your expenses.
            Prepaid
            plans allow you to pay for the services upfront, and you can top up or renew them as needed. MVNOs often
            provide competitive prepaid plans, so explore these options as well.
          </p>


          <h5>Postpaid</h5>

          <p class="ms-3">
            Unlike prepaid plans where you pay in advance for a certain amount of usage, postpaid plans involve you
            using
            the services first and then receiving a bill for the usage at the end of the billing cycle which is usually
            the end of the month. Most postpaid plans offer unlimited talk and text, and a certain amount of data. May
            require a credit check.
          </p>

          <p class="ms-3">
            Postpaid plans often come with benefits such as the ability to use the services without worrying about
            running
            out of credit, access to premium features, better customer support, and the option to upgrade to new devices
            at discounted rates.

          <h5>Family Plans</h5>

          <p class="ms-3">
            A family plan covers everyone in your family who you add to the plan. Generally, this includes you, your
            spouse, and your children up to age 26. The primary purpose of family plans is to offer cost savings and
            convenience for families or groups of people who live together and want to share a service.
          </p>

          <ul>
            <li>
              <strong>Shared Usage and Billing:</strong> With a family plan, all lines within the plan share a common
              pool of resources,
              such
              as voice minutes, text messages, and mobile data. The primary account holder receives a single bill for
              all
              lines, simplifying the billing process.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Cost Savings:</strong> Family plans often offer cost advantages compared to individual plans.
              Carriers frequently
              provide discounts on monthly service fees when multiple lines are included in a family plan. This can
              result
              in significant savings, especially when compared to the cost of individual plans for each member.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Different Line Options:</strong> Family plans accommodate different types of lines, where each
              line can have its
              own
              phone number and individual usage limits, ensuring flexibility in meeting the communication needs of each
              family member.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Shared Data Allowance:</strong> In many family plans, the mobile data allowance is shared among
              all lines. This
              means
              that all family members draw from the same data pool. It is important to consider the data needs of each
              member and choose a plan with an appropriate data allocation to avoid exceeding the limit or incurring
              additional charges.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Managing Usage and Controls:</strong> Family plans often provide tools for managing and monitoring
              usage. The
              primary
              account holder can set usage limits, control content access for specific lines (especially useful for
              children), and receive notifications or alerts regarding usage. These features enable better control over
              expenses and ensure responsible usage.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Eligibility and Line Additions:</strong> To add additional lines to a family plan, carriers
              typically require the
              primary account holder to be a legal adult and undergo a credit check. Some carriers may also have
              restrictions on the number of lines that can be added to a plan.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Device Purchases and Upgrades:</strong> Family plans allow for flexibility in device purchases and
              upgrades. Each
              line
              can have its own device, and members can select phones that meet their individual preferences and needs.
              Some
              carriers offer installment plans or discounted pricing on devices when purchased as part of a family plan.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Note:</strong> Before selecting a family plan, consider the specific needs of your family members,
              including their
              voice, messaging, and data requirements. Research and compare family plans offered by different carriers
              to
              find the one that offers the most suitable combination of features, coverage, and pricing for your
              family's
              needs.
            </li>
          </ul>

            Phone Plan with Mobile

          </h5>
          <p class="ms-3">
            A lot of mobile carriers offer to add the mobile device payment on the billing statement of your phone
            service if you get the device with them. If you do get a phone device with your phone plan, the payment will
            be added to the monthly installment fees. So, you will need to pay it off before you want to switch your
            carriers.

            </div>
          </div>

          <p>
            In this section, we'll delve into the key concepts related to the compatibility of mobile network
            technologies
            and how they impact your choice of carriers and phone services in the United States. Understanding these
            compatibility factors is crucial for making informed decisions about your choice of carrier and mobile
            phone.
          </p>

          <h5>GSM (Global System for Mobile Communications)</h5>
          <p class="ms-3">
            GSM is the most widely used mobile network technology worldwide, including in the United States. If you have
            a
            GSM-compatible phone, it should work with most carriers in the US. This technology uses SIM (Subscriber
            Identity Module) cards, which contain your subscriber information and allow you to easily switch between
            phones or carriers by swapping the SIM card.
          </p>

          <h5>CDMA (Code Division Multiple Access)</h5>
          <p class="ms-3">
            CDMA is another mobile network technology used by some carriers in the US, although it is less common
            compared
            to GSM. Unlike GSM, CDMA doesn't use SIM cards. Instead, CDMA carriers link the subscriber's information to
            the phone itself. This means that CDMA phones are typically locked to a specific carrier and cannot be
            easily
            switched to another CDMA carrier. If you have a CDMA phone, you may need to check if it is compatible with
            your desired carrier's network before activating service.
          </p>

          <h5>Compatibility and Carrier Choices</h5>
          <p class="ms-3">
            GSM phones are generally more versatile and compatible with a wide range of carriers globally. If you have a
            GSM phone, you will have a broader selection of carriers to choose from in the US. You can switch carriers
            by
            simply replacing the SIM card, which offers flexibility and convenience.
          </p>

          <h5>Checking Phone Compatibility</h5>
          <p class="ms-3">
            To determine if your phone is compatible with a specific carrier, you can check the phone's specifications
            or
            contact the carrier directly. Carriers usually provide online tools or customer support services to verify
            compatibility. In some cases, you may need to unlock your GSM phone from your previous carrier to use it
            with
            a new carrier.
          </p>

          <h5>LTE and 5G Compatibility</h5>
          <p class="ms-3">
            As you research mobile carriers, consider the compatibility of your phone with the carrier's LTE (Long-Term
            Evolution) and 5G networks. LTE is the prevailing high-speed data network in the US, while 5G is the
            next-generation network that offers even faster speeds and low latency. Ensure your phone supports the LTE
            bands and 5G frequencies used by your chosen carrier to maximize the mobile data experience.
          </p>

          <p class="ms-3">
            Remember to check with carriers directly or visit their websites for the most up-to-date information on
            network types and phone compatibility. By understanding these mobile network technologies and their
            implications, you can make an informed decision when selecting a mobile phone service provider in the US
            that
            aligns with your phone's compatibility and preferences.

            </div>
          </div>

          <h5>Locked Devices</h5>
          <p class="ms-3">
            A locked mobile device is one that is tied ("locked") to a specific carrier or network provider, like AT&T
            or
            Verizon. This means that the device is programmed to work only with SIM cards from that particular carrier.
            Locked phones have a software code on them that prevents the user from using other networks. These devices
            often come with discounted prices or installment plans when purchased through a carrier and may have
            carrier-specific features or apps pre-installed. However, these devices are limited to using the carrier's
            network and services. They typically require unlocking to use with other carriers, and you need to unlock it
            before you leave for a different country.
          </p>

          <h5>Unlocked Devices</h5>
          <p class="ms-3">
            An unlocked mobile device is not tied to any specific carrier. These devices are not restricted to a single
            network and can accept SIM cards from any carrier that uses compatible technology (e.g., GSM or CDMA). These
            devices give you the freedom to switch between carriers and plans without unlocking. You can also use local
            SIM cards while traveling internationally, potentially saving on roaming fees. If you plan on reselling the
            device, the value may be higher since the device is not carrier-locked. One downside to these devices is
            that
            they often come with higher upfront costs compared to the carrier-subsidized devices. However, it is worth
            it
            if you travel internationally or plan on switching your carrier in the future.
          </p>

          <h5>Unlocking a Locked Device</h5>
          <p class="ms-3">
            If you have a locked device and want to use it with a different carrier, you will need to "unlock" it. This
            involves contacting your current carrier and requesting an unlock code or instructions. Once unlocked, the
            device can accept SIM cards from other carriers.
          </p>

          <!-- ======= Note ======= -->
          <div class="alert alert-primary" role="alert">
            A carrier can only unlock an iPhone that has been fully paid off.

          <h5>Apple iPhone Upgrade Program</h5>
          <p class="ms-3">
            The Apple iPhone Upgrade Program is a service offered by Apple that allows customers to purchase a new
            iPhone
            and spread out the cost over a period of time through monthly installments. It's designed to make it easier
            for customers to stay up-to-date with the latest iPhone models without having to pay the full retail price
            upfront. For more information visit their website

            >here</a>
            or read the information below:
          </p>

          <ul>
            <li>
              <strong>Reduced Rate Credit Plan:</strong> This type of financing offers a fixed, often lower interest
              rate on the financed
              amount. The interest rate is typically advertised as lower than the standard credit card interest rates.
              With
              a reduced rate credit plan, you will pay interest on the remaining balance over the course of the
              financing
              term. The interest is calculated based on the outstanding balance and the agreed-upon interest rate. Since
              the
              interest rate is fixed in this plan, you can accurately predict the interest costs over the term. But you
              will
              still need to pay interest on the financed amount, which could add to the overall cost of your purchase.
              There
              might also be fees associated with setting up the credit plan.
            </li>

            <li>
              <strong>Deferred Interest Financing:</strong> Deferred interest financing is often marketed as "0%
              interest" or "no interest if
              paid in full within [X] months." This means that you won't incur interest charges during the promotional
              period, which is usually a set number of months. However, if you fail to pay off the full balance within
              that
              time frame, you could be retroactively charged interest on the entire original purchase amount from the
              date
              of purchase, often at a higher interest rate. These plans are good if you can pay off the balance within
              the
              promotional period, and won't incur any interest charges. They also allow you to make a large purchase
              without
              immediate financial strain. However, if you don't pay off the full balance within the promotional period,
              you
              could be hit with a significant amount of retroactive interest. So, make sure you carefully understand the
              terms and conditions to avoid surprises.

          <h5>First Weeks</h5>
          <p class="ms-3">
            Most students consider family plans to be their preferred long-term solution for fulfilling their phone
            requirements. Nevertheless, prior to selecting a group of individuals to join a family plan with, opting for
            a
            temporary SIM card is advisable. As of 2023, Google Fi stands out as one of the most recommended choices in
            this regard. To streamline the purchasing process, simply follow these steps when you're prepared to make
            your
            decision:
          </p>

          <h5>Determine Requirements</h5>

          <ul>
            <li>
              Decide what type of phone service you need. Will it be a prepaid plan, postpaid plan, or a family plan?
            </li>

            <li>
              Consider factors like data usage, talk time, international calling needs, and budget.
            </li>
          </ul>

          <h5>Select a Plan</h5>
          <ul>
            <li>
              Pick the type of contract you want from Prepaid, Postpaid and Family plans.
            </li>

            <li>
              Mobile data is essential for internet access on your phone. Determine your data usage needs and choose a
              plan
              accordingly that suits your needs and budget.
            </li>

            <li>
              Plans typically include data, talk time, and text messages. Some plans might also include international
              calling or data roaming options. Most carriers offer different data packages, ranging from limited to
              unlimited options.
            </li>

            <li>
              If you have access to Wi-Fi at home and work, you may be able to opt for a more affordable plan with lower
              data limits.
            </li>
          </ul>


          <h5>After Selecting a Plan</h5>

          <ol>

            <li>
              Visit a Retail Store or Website
              <ul>
                <li>
                  Once you have researched and chosen a Carrier, visit their stores to inquire about plans, activate
                  your
                  service, and obtain a SIM card.
                </li>
                <li>
                  Alternatively, you can order SIM cards and activate services online through carrier websites or
                  authorized
                  retailers.
                </li>
                <li>
                  Ensure to carry your identification documents, such as your passport or visa, as they may be required
                  during
                  the activation process.
                </li>
              </ul>
            </li>

            <li>
              Choose a Device or Bring an Unlocked one
              <ul>
                <li>
                  If you already have an unlocked phone that supports GSM networks, you can simply insert a US SIM card
                  and
                  start using it.
                </li>
                <li>
                  If your phone is locked to a specific carrier or incompatible with US networks, you may need to
                  purchase a new
                  phone.
                </li>
                <li>
                  If you need a new phone, select a device from the carrier's offerings. This might include smartphones
                  or basic
                  phones.
                </li>
                <li>
                  There are some carriers that have promotions that give you a new device with your line.

            In simple words, credit score is a numerical representation (a
            three-digit number) of your creditworthiness, providing lenders
            and financial institutions with an assessment of the risk of
            extending credit to you. In the United States, credit scores are
            generated by <strong>credit bureaus</strong> based on the
            information in your <strong>credit report</strong>. The most
            commonly used credit scoring models are the FICO Score and
            VantageScore. These scores typically range from 300 to 850, with
            a higher score indicating better creditworthiness.

          <p>
            Credit is a financial arrangement that allows you to borrow
            money or access goods and services with a promise to repay the
            amount later, usually with interest. It is like receiving
            something of value now and agreeing to pay for it in the future.
            <br />
            When you use credit, you are essentially borrowing money from a
            lender, such as a bank, financial institution, or credit card
            company. The lender trusts that you will repay the money based
            on the terms and conditions agreed upon, which often include
            paying back the borrowed amount over time, along with an
            additional fee called interest.
          </p>
          <p>
            There are different types of credit that you might encounter:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              <strong>Loans</strong>: These are specific amounts of money
              borrowed from a lender that you must repay in fixed
              installments over a set period. Common examples include car
              loans, student loans, and home mortgages.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Credit Cards</strong>: Credit cards allow you to make
              purchases on credit, up to a predetermined credit limit. You
              can choose to pay the full balance or a minimum amount each
              month. If you don't pay the full balance, interest will be
              added to the remaining amount.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong> Lines of Credit </strong>: This is a pre-approved
              amount of credit that you can access as needed, similar to a
              credit card. However, it is typically used for larger expenses
              or emergencies.
            </li>
          </ul>

            "Credit" refers to the ability to borrow money, while a "credit
            report" is a detailed record of a person's credit history,
            including their borrowing and payment behavior. The "credit
            score" is a numerical representation of the information in the
            credit report.

          <h5>Credit Report</h5>
          <div class="ms-3">
            <p>
              A credit report is a detailed record of an individual's credit
              history and financial behavior. It serves as a crucial
              document that provides lenders and other authorized entities
              with insight into a person's creditworthiness and how they
              manage their financial obligations. Credit reports are
              compiled and maintained by credit bureaus, also known as
              credit reporting agencies, such as Experian, Equifax, and
              TransUnion.
            </p>

              <strong>
                Information recorded in a credit report are:

            </p>
            <ul>
              <li>
                Credit Accounts: Credit reports include information about
                various credit accounts that an individual holds. This
                includes credit cards, mortgages, auto loans, personal
                loans, student loans, and other lines of credit.
              </li>
              <li>
                Payment History: The credit report records the payment
                history associated with each credit account. It shows
                whether payments were made on time or if there were any late
                payments or delinquencies.
              </li>
              <li>
                Credit Utilization: Credit reports indicate the credit
                utilization ratio for each credit card account. This ratio
                represents the percentage of available credit that a person
                is using and is an essential factor in credit score
                calculations.
              </li>
              <li>
                Public Records: Certain financial events, such as
                bankruptcies, tax liens, judgments, and foreclosures, are
                considered public records and are included in the credit
                report.
              </li>
              <li>
                Credit Inquiries: Credit reports show a list of inquiries
                made by lenders when an individual applies for credit. There
                are two types of inquiries: hard inquiries and soft
                inquiries. Hard inquiries made by lenders when considering a
                credit application may have a temporary negative impact on
                the credit score, while soft inquiries, like checking one's
                own credit report, do not affect the score.
              </li>
              <li>
                Personal Information: The credit report includes personal
                information such as name, address, date of birth, Social
                Security number, and employment history. It helps verify the
                individual's identity and may be used to match their credit
                history to the correct person.

                Income: Credit reports do not include information about an

              <li>
                Bank Account Balances: Credit reports do not contain details

              Credit agencies, also known as credit reporting agencies or
              credit bureaus, are independent organizations that collect and
              maintain credit information on individuals and businesses.
              These agencies play a crucial role in the financial industry
              by providing credit reports and credit scores to lenders,
              landlords, employers, and other authorized entities. The
              information gathered by credit agencies allows these entities
              to assess the creditworthiness of individuals and make
              informed decisions about granting credit, offering loans, or
              extending other financial services. Important credit agencies

              length of credit history, types of credit used, and recent
              credit inquiries. Each of these factors holds a different
              level of importance in determining your overall credit score.

            In the United States, two primary credit scoring models are
            widely used to calculate credit scores: FICO Score and
            VantageScore. Both models assess an individual's
            creditworthiness based on information from credit reports, but
            they have distinct methodologies and may weigh factors

          <h5>FICO Score</h5>
          <div class="ms-3">
            <p>
              FICO (Fair Isaac Corporation) Score is one of the oldest and
              most widely recognized credit scoring models. It was developed
              by the Fair Isaac Corporation and is widely used by lenders to
              make credit decisions. FICO Scores range from 300 to 850, with
              higher scores indicating better creditworthiness.
            </p>
            <p class="mb-0">
              <strong> Key Features of FICO Score include: </strong>
            </p>
          </div>
          <ul>
            <li>
              FICO Scores primarily consider factors such as payment
              history, credit utilization, length of credit history, types
              of credit used, and recent credit inquiries.
            </li>
            <li>
              Payment history, especially on-time payments, carries
              significant weight in the FICO Score calculation.
            </li>
            <li>
              FICO Scores may consider both positive and negative credit
              information, including late payments, bankruptcies, and
              collections.
            </li>
            <li>
              Public Records: Certain financial events, such as
              bankruptcies, tax liens, judgments, and foreclosures, are
              considered public records and are included in the credit
              report.
            </li>
          </ul>
          <h5>VantageScore</h5>
          <div class="ms-3">
            <p>
              VantageScore is a credit scoring model developed jointly by
              the three major credit bureaus: Experian, Equifax, and
              TransUnion. It was introduced as an alternative to the FICO
              Score and uses a different scoring range. VantageScores range
              from 300 to 850, just like FICO Scores.
            </p>
            <p class="mb-0">
              <strong> Key Features of VantageScore includes: </strong>
            </p>
            <ul>
              <li>
                VantageScore uses similar factors as FICO Score, such as
                payment history, credit utilization, length of credit
                history, credit mix, and recent credit inquiries.
              </li>
              <li>
                However, VantageScore may place more emphasis on trending
                credit data, which considers recent credit behavior over
                time.
              </li>
              <li>
                VantageScore may also consider alternative data, such as
                utility and rent payments, to assess creditworthiness for
                individuals with limited credit histories.
              </li>
            </ul>
          </div>
          <h5>Differences Between FICO Score and VantageScore</h5>
          <div class="ms-3">
            <p>
              While both FICO Score and VantageScore serve the same purpose
              of assessing creditworthiness, and they have similar scoring
              range, there are some differences between the two models:
            </p>
            <ul>
              <li>
                <strong>Tri-Bureau vs. Bureau-Specific Models:</strong>
                VantageScore creates a single tri-bureau model that can be
                used with a credit report from Experian, Equifax or
                TransUnion. However, FICO creates bureau-specific scoring
                models. So, while the latest FICO Score (version 9) might
                have one name, there are actually three slightly different
                FICO Score 9 models, one for each of the major credit
                reporting agencies.
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>Factors Weighting:</strong> The weight given to
                specific credit factors may differ between the two models.
                For example, the importance of payment history and credit
                utilization may vary.
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>Weighting</strong>: FICO gives more weight to
                payment history, while VantageScore's latest version
                emphasizes total credit usage and balances.
              </li>

            <strong>Other Credit Scoring Models</strong>
            <br />
            There are alternative credit scoring models developed by various
            companies and financial institutions. These models may consider
            different data sources and use unique algorithms to calculate

            Some specialized models assess creditworthiness based on factors
            relevant to each specific type of loan. For example, Experian's
            FICO Auto Score, which is used for car loans, and FICO Mortgage
            Score, which is used for mortgage loans.

              <h2 class="h4">Important Factors</h2>
            </div>
          </div>
          <p>
            Various factors contribute to your credit score, and
            understanding them will help you take actions to improve and
            maintain a good score. Credit scores are calculated using
            various factors and weighted differently depending on the
            scoring model. The factors commonly considered in credit score
            calculations include:
          </p>
          <h5>Payment History</h5>
          <p class="ms-3">
            Your payment history is a crucial factor that heavily influences
            your credit score. Lenders want to see a track record of
            responsible credit management. Late payments, delinquencies, or
            accounts in collections can significantly impact your score
            negatively. Making consistent, on-time payments is vital for
            maintaining a good credit score.
          </p>

          <h5>Credit Utilization</h5>
          <p class="ms-3">
            Credit utilization refers to the amount of credit you're using
            compared to the total credit available to you. This ratio has a
            significant impact on your credit score. It's recommended to
            keep your credit utilization below 30% of your available credit.
            High utilization can indicate a higher credit risk and
            potentially lower your credit score.
          </p>

          <h5>Length of Credit History</h5>
          <p class="ms-3">
            The length of your credit history plays a role in determining
            your creditworthiness. Generally, a longer credit history is
            beneficial, as it provides more information for lenders to
            assess your credit behavior. This factor considers the age of
            your oldest account, the average age of all your accounts, and
            the time since your most recent activity on each account.
          </p>

          <h5>Types of Credit</h5>
          <p class="ms-3">
            The types of credit you have, such as credit cards, loans, or
            mortgages, impact your credit score. A diverse mix of credit
            accounts, including both revolving credit (like credit cards)
            and installment loans (like car loans), can positively influence
            your score.
          </p>

          <h5>New Credit Inquiries</h5>
          <p class="ms-3">
            When you apply for new credit, it generates a hard inquiry on
            your credit report. Multiple recent inquiries can indicate a
            higher credit risk. However, when you check your own credit or
            lenders perform soft inquiries for pre-approval purposes, they
            do not impact your credit score.

            Maintaining a good credit score is crucial for your financial
            well-being. Your credit score influences your ability to secure
            loans, obtain favorable interest rates, and even impacts your
            housing and employment opportunities. Regularly monitoring your
            credit score is essential for identifying potential issues and
            tracking your progress.
          </p>
          <h5>Free Credit Reports by Credit Bureaus</h5>
          <p class="ms-3">
            Request free copies of your credit reports from the three major
            credit bureaus - Experian, Equifax, and TransUnion. Under
            federal law, you are entitled to one free credit report from
            each bureau every 12 months through AnnualCreditReport.com, the
            official website mandated by the U.S. government for free credit
            reports. Review these reports to ensure all information is
            accurate and up-to-date.

            Regularly monitoring your credit can help you detect signs of
            identity theft or fraudulent activities. If you notice any
            unauthorized accounts or inquiries on your credit report, take
            immediate action to protect yourself from potential identity
            theft.

            <strong>Set Reminders for Credit Check-ups</strong>
            <br />
            Make it a habit to check your credit score regularly. Set up
            reminders to review your credit reports at least once a year or
            before applying for significant financial transactions, such as
            loans or credit cards.

          <h5>Check for Errors and Discrepancies</h5>
          <p class="ms-3">
            Thoroughly review your credit reports for errors, inaccuracies,
            or unfamiliar accounts. If you spot any discrepancies, promptly
            dispute them with the respective credit bureau to have the
            information corrected. Accurate credit reports are crucial for
            maintaining a reliable credit score.
          </p>

          <h5>Track Credit Score Changes</h5>
          <p class="ms-3">
            Keep an eye on your credit score's fluctuations over time. Any
            significant changes in your score could indicate shifts in your

            </div>

          <p>
            Typically, a SSN is required to build credit history, but
            alternative methods may be available for international students
            to establish credit without these identification numbers.
          </p>
          <h5>Credit History with ITIN</h5>
          <p class="ms-3">
            While not as widely accepted as an SSN, some financial
            institutions may accept an ITIN to open a bank account or apply
            for a secured credit card. It's worth inquiring with different
            lenders or credit issuers about their policies regarding ITINs.
          </p>
          <h5>Credit-Building Programs</h5>
          <p class="ms-3">
            Some financial institutions and credit bureaus offer programs
            specifically tailored to international students who lack an SSN
            or credit history. These programs may provide alternative ways
            to assess creditworthiness and start building credit. It's
            advisable to research and inquire with different institutions to
            see if they offer such programs.
          </p>
          <h5>Credit Cards for International Students</h5>
          <p class="ms-3">
            Certain credit card issuers provide credit cards designed for
            international students who don't have an SSN or credit history.
            These cards may have specific eligibility criteria, such as
            being enrolled in a U.S. educational institution, and they often
            have lower credit limits and higher interest rates. Applying for
            these cards can be a viable option to start building credit.
          </p>
          <h5>Credit Builder Loans (Secured Loans)</h5>
          <p class="ms-3">
            Credit builder loans, as mentioned earlier, are installment
            loans designed to help individuals establish credit. These loans
            may not require an SSN or credit history and can be a useful
            tool for building credit. Secured loans, where you provide
            collateral such as a deposit, may also be an option.
          </p>
          <h5>Rent Reporting Services</h5>
          <p class="ms-3">
            Your rental payment history is typically not reported to credit
            bureaus unless you have an SSN or voluntarily choose to report
            it. However, some rent reporting services allow you to report
            your rental payments, even without an SSN. These services work
            with your landlord to verify your payment history and report it
            to credit bureaus, helping you build credit based on your rental
            record.
          </p>
          <!-- ======= Note ======= -->
          <div class="alert alert-primary" role="alert">
            Different financial institutions and credit issuers may have
            varying requirements and programs to cater to individuals
            without an SSN or credit history. By exploring these
            alternatives and responsibly managing your finances, you can
            gradually build a positive credit history in the U.S.

          <p>
            A credit card is a plastic card issued by a bank or other
            financial institution. Unlike a debit card, which deducts money
            directly from your bank account when you make a purchase, a
            credit card allows you to borrow money from the card issuer up
            to a certain limit in order to buy goods or pay for services.
            <br />
            Consider a credit card as a type of loan: every time you use
            your credit card, you're borrowing money that you pledge to pay
            back. You can choose to repay the full amount borrowed at the
            end of a billing cycle, or you can carry over a balance to the
            next cycle. However, any balance that is not paid off will
            accrue interest. This is how the card issuer makes money.
            <br />
            The credit card is a powerful financial tool in the U.S.,
            allowing for convenience, fraud protection, and the ability to
            build a credit history. But it's important to remember that it
            must be used responsibly to avoid incurring debt and high
            interest charges.

            Understanding credit card use and management is crucial for
            financial well-being and responsible money handling.
            Familiarizing oneself with these key terms empowers individuals
            to make informed decisions, avoid unnecessary fees, and maintain
            a healthy credit score.

                  made within that billing cycle. It usually lasts around
                  21 to 25 days.

          </div>

          <h5>Credit Limit</h5>
          <div class="ms-3">
            <p>
              The credit limit is the maximum amount of money that a credit
              card issuer allows you to borrow on your credit card. It
              represents the highest balance you can carry on the card at
              any given time. For example, if your credit limit is $2,000,
              you can make purchases and accumulate balances on your credit
              card up to that amount. It's essential to manage your credit
              card spending responsibly and stay within your credit limit to
              avoid potential over-limit fees and negative impacts on your
              credit score.
            </p>
          </div>
          <h5>Annual Percentage Rate (APR)</h5>
          <p class="ms-3">
            APR stands for Annual Percentage Rate, and it represents the
            interest rate charged on outstanding credit card balances if you
            do not pay your full credit card bill by the due date. It's
            expressed as an annual percentage, indicating the cost of
            borrowing money over one year. For example, if your credit card
            has an APR of 18%, it means you'll be charged 18% interest on
            any remaining balance after the grace period ends. It's crucial
            to understand your credit card's APR, as it directly impacts the
            amount of interest you'll pay if you carry a balance on your
            card.
          </p>
          <h5>Billing Cycle</h5>
          <p class="ms-3">
            A billing cycle is the specific period between two consecutive
            credit card statements. It typically lasts around 30 days and
            represents the timeframe during which you make purchases and
            incur charges using your credit card. At the end of the billing
            cycle, the credit card issuer will generate a statement that
            shows all the transactions made during that period, along with
            the total outstanding balance. The statement will also include
            the minimum payment due and the due date for making the payment.
            It's essential to keep track of your billing cycle to manage
            your credit card usage and ensure timely payments to avoid
            interest charges.
          </p>

          <h5>Statement Balance</h5>
          <p class="ms-3">
            The statement balance is the total amount you owe on your credit
            card as of the last billing cycle's closing date. It includes
            all the purchases, balance transfers, cash advances, and any
            applicable fees or interest that have been posted to your
            account during that billing cycle. The statement balance is the
            amount you are required to pay by the due date specified on your
            credit card statement to avoid any late fees or additional
            interest charges. If you pay the statement balance in full by
            the due date, you won't incur any interest on the purchases made
            during that billing cycle.
          </p>

          <h5>Grace Period</h5>
          <p class="ms-3">
            A grace period is the period of time between the end of a
            billing cycle and the payment due date on a credit card. During
            this time, you have the opportunity to pay your credit card
            balance in full without incurring any interest charges on your
            purchases. The grace period typically lasts around 21 to 25
            days, giving cardholders a window to make timely payments. To
            take advantage of the grace period and avoid interest, it's
            essential to pay the full statement balance by the due date each
            month. However, keep in mind that grace periods usually do not
            apply to cash advances and balance transfers, which may start
            accruing interest immediately.

              <h2 class="h4">Understanding Credit Card Rewards</h2>
            </div>
          </div>
          <p>
            Rewards in the context of credit cards refer to the benefits or
            incentives that cardholders earn for using their cards to make
            purchases. They serve as incentives from credit card companies
            to encourage consumer spending. These rewards can be cash back,
            points for goods or services, or travel miles. The more a
            cardholder uses their credit card, the more rewards they
            accumulate, which can be redeemed in accordance with the card's
            specific rewards program. While beneficial, it's important to
            understand the rewards structure and responsible spending.
          </p>
          <h5>Cashback Rewards System</h5>
          <p class="ms-3">
            Rewarding mechanism that returns a percentage of the total
            amount spent on your card back to you. For instance, if a card
            offers 1% cash back on all purchases, you'll get $1 back for
            every $100 you spend.
            <br />
            However, it's important to note that cash back rewards can vary
            significantly among credit cards. Some cards offer a flat rate
            on all purchases, but many others have a tiered or bonus
            category system.
            <br />

            In a tiered system, different types of purchases earn different
            rates. For example, you might earn 3% cash back on groceries, 2%
            on gas, and 1% on all other purchases.

            <br />
            In a bonus category system, the categories that earn higher
            rates rotate periodically, typically every quarter. For
            instance, you might earn 5% on gas purchases one quarter, and
            then 5% on grocery store purchases the next quarter, with all
            other purchases earning a lower standard rate.
          </p>
          <h5>Points Rewards System</h5>
          <p class="ms-3">
            In this system, cardholders earn points for every dollar they
            spend using their credit card. The amount of points earned per
            dollar can vary based on the card's terms and conditions. For
            example, you might earn 2 points for every dollar spent on
            dining and 1 point per dollar on all other purchases.

            <br />

            These points can then be redeemed for various goods, services,
            or experiences through the credit card's reward program. Common
            redemption options include merchandise, gift cards, travel
            bookings, or even as cash back in some cases. It's important to
            note that the value of each point can differ from one card to
            another, and may also depend on what you're redeeming them for.
          </p>
          <h5>Miles Rewards System</h5>
          <p class="ms-3">
            Such systems are similar to points, but they're typically linked
            with travel-related purchases. For every dollar spent,
            cardholders earn a certain number of miles or travel points. The
            accumulation rate can vary based on categories - for instance,
            you might earn more miles for money spent on airfare or hotels.
            <br />
            These miles can then be redeemed for airfare, hotel stays, car
            rentals, and other travel-related expenses. Some credit cards
            have partnerships with specific airlines or hotel chains,
            allowing you to earn and redeem miles at a higher rate with
            those partners. Like points, the value of each mile can vary
            based on the credit card and redemption option.
          </p>

          <h5>Earning Rewards</h5>
          <p class="ms-3">
            You earn rewards based on your spending with the card. Different
            cards have different reward structures. Some cards offer a flat
            rate on all purchases, while others offer higher rates on
            certain categories of spending, like dining, groceries, or gas.
          </p>

          <h5>Redeeming Rewards</h5>
          <p class="ms-3">
            The process for redeeming rewards varies by card. You might be
            able to apply cash back directly to your credit card balance,
            deposit it into a bank account, or use it to purchase gift
            cards. Points or miles can typically be redeemed through the
            credit card company's rewards portal.
          </p>

            <strong>Understanding Terms and Conditions</strong>
            <br />
            It's very important to understand the terms and conditions of
            your credit card rewards program. Some rewards cards have annual
            fees, and the rewards you earn might not justify the cost if you
            don't use the card regularly. Additionally, some cards require
            you to redeem your rewards within a certain timeframe or they
            may expire.

            Understanding the different types of credit cards can help you
            choose the one that best fits your needs and spending habits.
            While the features, benefits, and terms can vary greatly.
          </p>

          <h5>Student Credit Cards</h5>
          <div class="ms-3">
            <p>
              Designed specifically for students with limited credit
              history, making them accessible and suitable for international
              students. These cards often have lower credit limits and may
              offer rewards or benefits tailored to student spending habits.
              They can be a great starting point for building credit while
              offering some financial flexibility.
            </p>
          </div>
          <h5>Secured Credit Cards</h5>
          <div class="ms-3">
            <p>
              Helpful for individuals with limited or poor credit history,
              as they require a cash deposit as collateral. For
              international students with no credit history in the U.S.,
              secured cards provide an opportunity to establish credit by
              demonstrating responsible card use. The cash deposit acts as
              security for the card issuer, making it easier to obtain
              approval.
            </p>
          </div>
          <h5>Low-Interest Credit Cards</h5>
          <div class="ms-3">
            <p>
              Useful for students who may occasionally carry a balance, as
              they offer lower ongoing interest rates. International
              students who anticipate carrying a balance on their credit
              card should consider low-interest cards to minimize interest
              costs.
            </p>
          </div>

          <h5>Retail Credit Cards</h5>
          <div class="ms-3">
            <p>
              May be beneficial for students who frequently shop at specific
              retailers, as they offer rewards and discounts at those
              stores. While retail cards can provide extra savings,
              international students should carefully consider their
              spending habits and ensure the rewards align with their needs.
            </p>
          </div>

          <h5>Rewards Credit Cards</h5>
          <div class="ms-3">
            <p>
              Can be attractive for students who want to earn rewards for
              their spending, but they should consider their specific
              spending habits. Rewards cards may offer cashback, points, or
              miles for eligible purchases, but students should choose one
              that complements their lifestyle and spending patterns.
            </p>
          </div>

          <h5>Cashback Credit Cards</h5>
          <div class="ms-3">
            <p>
              Provides straightforward cash rewards for eligible purchases,
              which can be useful for general spending. International
              students who prefer simplicity and cash rewards may find
              cashback cards appealing for everyday expenses.
