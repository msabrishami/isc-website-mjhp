            Grasping U.S. phone service terminology is vital, as the system and terms may differ significantly from
            those in other countries. Some of these terms are:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li><strong>Phone Number:</strong> In the U.S., phone numbers typically have 10 digits: a three-digit area
              code, followed by a
              seven-digit number (e.g., +1-123-456-7890).
            </li>

            <li><strong>Data:</strong> This refers to internet usage on your mobile device.</li>

            <li><strong>International Roaming:</strong> This is when your phone uses another carrier's network to
              maintain service when
              you're traveling outside of your provider's coverage area. Usually comes with a cost depending on the plan
              you have.
            </li>

            <li><strong>Mobile Hotspot/Tethering:</strong> This is when you use your smartphone as a portable Wi-Fi
              hotspot to share your
              phone's data connection with other devices, such as your laptop or tablet.
            </li>

            <li><strong>Mobile Carriers:</strong> Major carriers include AT&T, Verizon, T-Mobile, Sprint (now part of
              T-Mobile), and
              recently
              Google Fi.
            </li>

            <li><strong>Mobile Plan:</strong> There are numerous plans within each of the mobile carriers. See below and
              specific Mobile
              Carrier’s website for more detailed information about each of these plans.
            </li>
          </ul>

          <h5>Phone Number</h5>
          <p class="ms-3">
            In the U.S. and Canada, the parts of a phone number are the <strong>exit code</strong>, <strong>country
            code</strong>, <strong>area code</strong>, <strong>telephone prefix</strong>, and <strong>line
            number</strong>. The exit code lets you dial out of your home country. The
            country code is an
            identifier for a specific country. The area code directs calls to a broad region. The telephone prefix is
            a
            smaller area within that region, like a city. The line number identifies the specific phone you are trying
            to reach.
          </p>

          <!-- ======= Note ======= -->
          <div class="alert alert-primary" role="alert">
            <h5>Canada:</h5>
            <p>
              It is important to note that although the country code of Canada is the same as the US, calling Canada is
              considered an international call. Some plans support free calls to Canada but not all of them. So, be
              cautious about calling Canada. In cases where you were charged on accident, communicate that with your
              carrier’s customer service and they may waive the fee.

          <h5>Writing a Phone Number</h5>
          <p class="ms-3">
            How to write a phone number? In the United States, phone numbers are typically written in the following
            format: (XXX) XXX-XXXX, where "XXX" represents the area code and "XXXX" represents the local number. Here's
            an example: (123) 456-7890. Please note that the parentheses around the area code are optional, but they are
            commonly used for clarity.

            The US has several mobile carriers (wireless communications service providers) offering different plans and
            services. Major carriers include <strong>AT&T</strong>, <strong>Verizon</strong>, <strong>T-Mobile</strong>,
            <strong>Sprint</strong> (now part of T-Mobile), and recently <strong>Google
            Fi</strong>. Additionally, there are numerous <strong>Mobile Virtual Network Operators (MVNOs)</strong> that
            operate on these major
            networks and often offer more affordable plans.The websites to each of these carriers are:

              mobile services under its brand name using the network of a licensed mobile operator.

            In general, there are different types of mobile plans based on the method of the contracts, e.g. prepaid,
            postpaid, and family plans.
          </p>

          <h5>Prepaid</h5>

          <p class="ms-3">
            Pay for your service upfront. Once you've used your data, call minutes, and texts, you'll need to purchase
            more. Great for budgeting and avoiding unexpected costs. No long-term commitment required.
          </p>

          <p class="ms-3">
            Prepaid plans can be a good option for new international students, or travelers. These plans typically do
            not
            require a long-term contract or credit history. They offer flexibility and control over your expenses.
            Prepaid
            plans allow you to pay for the services upfront, and you can top up or renew them as needed. MVNOs often
            provide competitive prepaid plans, so explore these options as well.
          </p>


          <h5>Postpaid</h5>

          <p class="ms-3">
            Unlike prepaid plans where you pay in advance for a certain amount of usage, postpaid plans involve you
            using
            the services first and then receiving a bill for the usage at the end of the billing cycle which is usually
            the end of the month. Most postpaid plans offer unlimited talk and text, and a certain amount of data. May
            require a credit check.
          </p>

          <p class="ms-3">
            Postpaid plans often come with benefits such as the ability to use the services without worrying about
            running
            out of credit, access to premium features, better customer support, and the option to upgrade to new devices
            at discounted rates.

          <h5>Family Plans</h5>

          <p class="ms-3">
            A family plan covers everyone in your family who you add to the plan. Generally, this includes you, your
            spouse, and your children up to age 26. The primary purpose of family plans is to offer cost savings and
            convenience for families or groups of people who live together and want to share a service.
          </p>

          <ul>
            <li>
              <strong>Shared Usage and Billing:</strong> With a family plan, all lines within the plan share a common
              pool of resources,
              such
              as voice minutes, text messages, and mobile data. The primary account holder receives a single bill for
              all
              lines, simplifying the billing process.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Cost Savings:</strong> Family plans often offer cost advantages compared to individual plans.
              Carriers frequently
              provide discounts on monthly service fees when multiple lines are included in a family plan. This can
              result
              in significant savings, especially when compared to the cost of individual plans for each member.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Different Line Options:</strong> Family plans accommodate different types of lines, where each
              line can have its
              own
              phone number and individual usage limits, ensuring flexibility in meeting the communication needs of each
              family member.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Shared Data Allowance:</strong> In many family plans, the mobile data allowance is shared among
              all lines. This
              means
              that all family members draw from the same data pool. It is important to consider the data needs of each
              member and choose a plan with an appropriate data allocation to avoid exceeding the limit or incurring
              additional charges.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Managing Usage and Controls:</strong> Family plans often provide tools for managing and monitoring
              usage. The
              primary
              account holder can set usage limits, control content access for specific lines (especially useful for
              children), and receive notifications or alerts regarding usage. These features enable better control over
              expenses and ensure responsible usage.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Eligibility and Line Additions:</strong> To add additional lines to a family plan, carriers
              typically require the
              primary account holder to be a legal adult and undergo a credit check. Some carriers may also have
              restrictions on the number of lines that can be added to a plan.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Device Purchases and Upgrades:</strong> Family plans allow for flexibility in device purchases and
              upgrades. Each
              line
              can have its own device, and members can select phones that meet their individual preferences and needs.
              Some
              carriers offer installment plans or discounted pricing on devices when purchased as part of a family plan.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Note:</strong> Before selecting a family plan, consider the specific needs of your family members,
              including their
              voice, messaging, and data requirements. Research and compare family plans offered by different carriers
              to
              find the one that offers the most suitable combination of features, coverage, and pricing for your
              family's
              needs.
            </li>
          </ul>

            Phone Plan with Mobile

          </h5>
          <p class="ms-3">
            A lot of mobile carriers offer to add the mobile device payment on the billing statement of your phone
            service if you get the device with them. If you do get a phone device with your phone plan, the payment will
            be added to the monthly installment fees. So, you will need to pay it off before you want to switch your
            carriers.

            </div>
          </div>

          <p>
            In this section, we'll delve into the key concepts related to the compatibility of mobile network
            technologies
            and how they impact your choice of carriers and phone services in the United States. Understanding these
            compatibility factors is crucial for making informed decisions about your choice of carrier and mobile
            phone.
          </p>

          <h5>GSM (Global System for Mobile Communications)</h5>
          <p class="ms-3">
            GSM is the most widely used mobile network technology worldwide, including in the United States. If you have
            a
            GSM-compatible phone, it should work with most carriers in the US. This technology uses SIM (Subscriber
            Identity Module) cards, which contain your subscriber information and allow you to easily switch between
            phones or carriers by swapping the SIM card.
          </p>

          <h5>CDMA (Code Division Multiple Access)</h5>
          <p class="ms-3">
            CDMA is another mobile network technology used by some carriers in the US, although it is less common
            compared
            to GSM. Unlike GSM, CDMA doesn't use SIM cards. Instead, CDMA carriers link the subscriber's information to
            the phone itself. This means that CDMA phones are typically locked to a specific carrier and cannot be
            easily
            switched to another CDMA carrier. If you have a CDMA phone, you may need to check if it is compatible with
            your desired carrier's network before activating service.
          </p>

          <h5>Compatibility and Carrier Choices</h5>
          <p class="ms-3">
            GSM phones are generally more versatile and compatible with a wide range of carriers globally. If you have a
            GSM phone, you will have a broader selection of carriers to choose from in the US. You can switch carriers
            by
            simply replacing the SIM card, which offers flexibility and convenience.
          </p>

          <h5>Checking Phone Compatibility</h5>
          <p class="ms-3">
            To determine if your phone is compatible with a specific carrier, you can check the phone's specifications
            or
            contact the carrier directly. Carriers usually provide online tools or customer support services to verify
            compatibility. In some cases, you may need to unlock your GSM phone from your previous carrier to use it
            with
            a new carrier.
          </p>

          <h5>LTE and 5G Compatibility</h5>
          <p class="ms-3">
            As you research mobile carriers, consider the compatibility of your phone with the carrier's LTE (Long-Term
            Evolution) and 5G networks. LTE is the prevailing high-speed data network in the US, while 5G is the
            next-generation network that offers even faster speeds and low latency. Ensure your phone supports the LTE
            bands and 5G frequencies used by your chosen carrier to maximize the mobile data experience.
          </p>

          <p class="ms-3">
            Remember to check with carriers directly or visit their websites for the most up-to-date information on
            network types and phone compatibility. By understanding these mobile network technologies and their
            implications, you can make an informed decision when selecting a mobile phone service provider in the US
            that
            aligns with your phone's compatibility and preferences.

            </div>
          </div>

          <h5>Locked Devices</h5>
          <p class="ms-3">
            A locked mobile device is one that is tied ("locked") to a specific carrier or network provider, like AT&T
            or
            Verizon. This means that the device is programmed to work only with SIM cards from that particular carrier.
            Locked phones have a software code on them that prevents the user from using other networks. These devices
            often come with discounted prices or installment plans when purchased through a carrier and may have
            carrier-specific features or apps pre-installed. However, these devices are limited to using the carrier's
            network and services. They typically require unlocking to use with other carriers, and you need to unlock it
            before you leave for a different country.
          </p>

          <h5>Unlocked Devices</h5>
          <p class="ms-3">
            An unlocked mobile device is not tied to any specific carrier. These devices are not restricted to a single
            network and can accept SIM cards from any carrier that uses compatible technology (e.g., GSM or CDMA). These
            devices give you the freedom to switch between carriers and plans without unlocking. You can also use local
            SIM cards while traveling internationally, potentially saving on roaming fees. If you plan on reselling the
            device, the value may be higher since the device is not carrier-locked. One downside to these devices is
            that
            they often come with higher upfront costs compared to the carrier-subsidized devices. However, it is worth
            it
            if you travel internationally or plan on switching your carrier in the future.
          </p>

          <h5>Unlocking a Locked Device</h5>
          <p class="ms-3">
            If you have a locked device and want to use it with a different carrier, you will need to "unlock" it. This
            involves contacting your current carrier and requesting an unlock code or instructions. Once unlocked, the
            device can accept SIM cards from other carriers.
          </p>

          <!-- ======= Note ======= -->
          <div class="alert alert-primary" role="alert">
            A carrier can only unlock an iPhone that has been fully paid off.

          <h5>Apple iPhone Upgrade Program</h5>
          <p class="ms-3">
            The Apple iPhone Upgrade Program is a service offered by Apple that allows customers to purchase a new
            iPhone
            and spread out the cost over a period of time through monthly installments. It's designed to make it easier
            for customers to stay up-to-date with the latest iPhone models without having to pay the full retail price
            upfront. For more information visit their website

            >here</a>
            or read the information below:
          </p>

          <ul>
            <li>
              <strong>Reduced Rate Credit Plan:</strong> This type of financing offers a fixed, often lower interest
              rate on the financed
              amount. The interest rate is typically advertised as lower than the standard credit card interest rates.
              With
              a reduced rate credit plan, you will pay interest on the remaining balance over the course of the
              financing
              term. The interest is calculated based on the outstanding balance and the agreed-upon interest rate. Since
              the
              interest rate is fixed in this plan, you can accurately predict the interest costs over the term. But you
              will
              still need to pay interest on the financed amount, which could add to the overall cost of your purchase.
              There
              might also be fees associated with setting up the credit plan.
            </li>

            <li>
              <strong>Deferred Interest Financing:</strong> Deferred interest financing is often marketed as "0%
              interest" or "no interest if
              paid in full within [X] months." This means that you won't incur interest charges during the promotional
              period, which is usually a set number of months. However, if you fail to pay off the full balance within
              that
              time frame, you could be retroactively charged interest on the entire original purchase amount from the
              date
              of purchase, often at a higher interest rate. These plans are good if you can pay off the balance within
              the
              promotional period, and won't incur any interest charges. They also allow you to make a large purchase
              without
              immediate financial strain. However, if you don't pay off the full balance within the promotional period,
              you
              could be hit with a significant amount of retroactive interest. So, make sure you carefully understand the
              terms and conditions to avoid surprises.

          <h5>First Weeks</h5>
          <p class="ms-3">
            Most students consider family plans to be their preferred long-term solution for fulfilling their phone
            requirements. Nevertheless, prior to selecting a group of individuals to join a family plan with, opting for
            a
            temporary SIM card is advisable. As of 2023, Google Fi stands out as one of the most recommended choices in
            this regard. To streamline the purchasing process, simply follow these steps when you're prepared to make
            your
            decision:
          </p>

          <h5>Determine Requirements</h5>

          <ul>
            <li>
              Decide what type of phone service you need. Will it be a prepaid plan, postpaid plan, or a family plan?
            </li>

            <li>
              Consider factors like data usage, talk time, international calling needs, and budget.
            </li>
          </ul>

          <h5>Select a Plan</h5>
          <ul>
            <li>
              Pick the type of contract you want from Prepaid, Postpaid and Family plans.
            </li>

            <li>
              Mobile data is essential for internet access on your phone. Determine your data usage needs and choose a
              plan
              accordingly that suits your needs and budget.
            </li>

            <li>
              Plans typically include data, talk time, and text messages. Some plans might also include international
              calling or data roaming options. Most carriers offer different data packages, ranging from limited to
              unlimited options.
            </li>

            <li>
              If you have access to Wi-Fi at home and work, you may be able to opt for a more affordable plan with lower
              data limits.
            </li>
          </ul>


          <h5>After Selecting a Plan</h5>

          <ol>

            <li>
              Visit a Retail Store or Website
              <ul>
                <li>
                  Once you have researched and chosen a Carrier, visit their stores to inquire about plans, activate
                  your
                  service, and obtain a SIM card.
                </li>
                <li>
                  Alternatively, you can order SIM cards and activate services online through carrier websites or
                  authorized
                  retailers.
                </li>
                <li>
                  Ensure to carry your identification documents, such as your passport or visa, as they may be required
                  during
                  the activation process.
                </li>
              </ul>
            </li>

            <li>
              Choose a Device or Bring an Unlocked one
              <ul>
                <li>
                  If you already have an unlocked phone that supports GSM networks, you can simply insert a US SIM card
                  and
                  start using it.
                </li>
                <li>
                  If your phone is locked to a specific carrier or incompatible with US networks, you may need to
                  purchase a new
                  phone.
                </li>
                <li>
                  If you need a new phone, select a device from the carrier's offerings. This might include smartphones
                  or basic
                  phones.
                </li>
                <li>
                  There are some carriers that have promotions that give you a new device with your line.
