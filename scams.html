                A scam is a deceptive scheme or trick used to cheat someone out of something, often money. Scams are designed to appear as legitimate offers, deals, or situations in order to lure people into providing money, personal information, or other resources. The individuals or organizations that run scams (scammers) typically use a variety of tactics to convince their targets that their intentions are genuine. However, the main goal of a scam is to benefit the scammer at the expense of the victim.
              </p>

                Scammers specifically target the international students as their potential victim. As an example, only at USC during the 2021-2022 academic year, a combined total loss of close to $500,000 was reported. This amount was increased to $1,000,000 during the 2022-2023 academic year.

                Phone call scams involve fraudsters using deceptive techniques over the phone to manipulate individuals into divulging personal information or sending money. Often disguised as legitimate entities such as banks, tax agencies, or technical support, these scammers exploit fear, urgency, or trust to achieve their malicious objectives, leading to financial losses or identity theft for the unsuspecting victim.

              <div class="alert alert-primary" role="alert">
                In many cases, callers will use a technique to mask their true caller ID with another government listed phone number or number of a private institution like a bank. If you are unsure about who is calling, tell the individual that you are busy and write down the callerâ€™s name and phone number. If the caller refuses, hang up. Government agencies do not request payment over the phone.             
              </div>
              <h5>Government Impersonators</h5>
              <p class="ms-3">Scammers pretend to be government officials, such as the IRS or USCIS, and claim that you owe money or there's a problem with your immigration status. They might demand immediate payment, often through unusual methods like gift cards or wire transfers.</p>
              <h5>Tech Support Scams</h5>
              <p class="ms-3">Scammers claim to be from tech companies like Microsoft or Apple, warning about a problem with your computer. They might ask for remote access to your device or request payment to fix a non-existent issue.</p>

                Text message scams involve deceptive messages sent to mobile phones with the intent to mislead recipients into providing personal or financial information. Leveraging tactics such as urgent prompts, fake rewards, or alarming threats, scammers aim to exploit human psychology to gain unauthorized access, commit fraud, or distribute malware. It's crucial to approach unexpected messages with caution and verify their authenticity before taking any action.

              <h5>Bank Phishing Scams</h5>
              <p class="ms-3">You might receive a message that appears to be from your bank, saying there's a problem with your account. The message might include a link to a website that looks like your bank's, where you're asked to input your account details. This is a trick to steal your information.</p>

                Email scams, often called "phishing," are deceptive tactics used by cybercriminals to trick recipients into divulging personal information, such as passwords or credit card numbers. By crafting convincing messages that appear to be from legitimate sources, scammers prey on unsuspecting individuals, leading to financial loss, identity theft, and other serious repercussions. Always exercise caution before clicking on links or sharing personal data online.
              </p>
              <h5>Phishing</h5>
              <p class="ms-3">Similar to the text message bank scams, phishing emails may look like they're from a trusted source. They might ask you to click a link and enter personal information. Always check the sender's email address and never click on suspicious links.
              </p>

              <h5>Lottery or Prize Scams</h5>
              <p class="ms-3">These emails claim you've won a large sum of money or a prize. They'll ask you to pay a fee or provide personal information to claim your winnings.
              </p>

              <h5>Employment Scams</h5>
              <p class="ms-3">These emails offer too-good-to-be-true job opportunities. They might ask you to pay a fee for training or supplies, or request your personal information.

                            Mail scams are deceptive schemes disseminated via traditional postal mail, intending to defraud recipients. They often present false promises of significant financial gains, solicit personal information, or demand upfront payments, preying on unsuspecting individuals. While the medium has evolved with the advent of email and digital communication, the essence of these scams remains consistent: to exploit trust for illicit gain. It's crucial to approach unsolicited mail with skepticism and verify its legitimacy before taking any action.

              </p>
              <h5>Advance Fee Fraud </h5>
              <p class="ms-3">The scammer asks for a deposit, rent payment, or administrative fee before you've met them or seen the property. 
              </p>
              <!-- ======= Note ======= -->
              <div class="alert alert-primary" role="alert">
                Prevention: Never pay money before you see the property and sign a contract. Use secure payment methods, not wire transfers or direct deposit to an unknown account.              
              </div>

              <h5>Rental Scam </h5>
              <p class="ms-3">The scammer advertises a property (which may not exist or be already occupied) and tries to collect a deposit or first month's rent.
              </p>
              <!-- ======= Note ======= -->
              <div class="alert alert-primary" role="alert">
              Prevention: Always visit the property in person before agreeing to rent. Check that the person showing you the property is indeed the owner or property manager.
              </div>

              <h5>Overpayment Scam </h5>
              <p class="ms-3">The scammer overpays with a check or money order and asks you to wire the difference back. The original payment is fake and will bounce.
              </p>
              <!-- ======= Note ======= -->
              <div class="alert alert-primary" role="alert">
                Prevention: Never accept overpayments, and avoid dealing with landlords who propose such schemes.
              </div>

              <h5>Identity Theft</h5>
              <p class="ms-3">The scammer uses the leasing process to get your personal information for identity theft.

              </p>
              <!-- ======= Note ======= -->
              <div class="alert alert-primary" role="alert">
              Prevention: Be careful about the information you provide. Only give your Social Security number and other sensitive personal data when you're sure it's a legitimate lease application.              
              </div>

              <h5>Sublet Scams</h5>
              <p class="ms-3">A scammer rents a property so they can show it to you, then sublets it to multiple people and disappears with the deposits and first months' rent.
              </p>
              <!-- ======= Note ======= -->
              <div class="alert alert-primary" role="alert">
                Prevention: Ask to see proof of their right to lease the property to you, such as a copy of their lease agreement with their landlord's contact information.              </div>

                    Never give personal information to unsolicited requests: If you didn't initiate the contact, don't provide any personal information.
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    Beware of high-pressure tactics: Scammers often create a sense of urgency to get you to react without thinking.
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    Don't trust caller ID: Scammers can spoof numbers to make it look like they're calling from a legitimate organization.
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    Research unknown contacts or companies: If you're unsure about a contact or company, do some online research to see if they're legitimate.

                Identity theft refers to the deliberate use of someone else's personal information, typically to gain financial benefits or access to resources without permission. As technology has progressed, the ways in which individuals can steal and exploit others' identities have multiplied. This malicious activity can lead to financial losses, damage to one's credit history, and significant emotional distress for the victims.

                When a criminal presents another person's identity during an arrest or investigation, it results in the real person potentially bearing a wrongful criminal record. This can have long-standing repercussions on the victim's life, including challenges with employment or legal complexities.
