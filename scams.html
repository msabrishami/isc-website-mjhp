    			<p>A scam is a deceptive scheme or trick used to cheat someone out of something, often money. Scams are designed to appear as legitimate offers, deals, or situations in order to lure people into providing money, personal information, or other resources. The individuals or organizations that run scams (scammers) typically use a variety of tactics to convince their targets that their intentions are genuine. However, the main goal of a scam is to benefit the scammer at the expense of the victim.</p>
<div class="alert alert-primary" role="alert">
Scammers specifically target the international students as their potential victim. As an example, only at USC during the 2021-2022 academic year, a combined total loss of close to $500,000 was reported. This amount was increased to $1,000,000 during the 2022-2023 academic year.</div>

    				</div>	
                    
        			<p>Here are some common scam scenarios that specifically target students, with a focus on international students.</p>

                    <h5>Visa and Immigration Status Threats</h5>
            		<p class="ms-3">International students receive a call from an individual claiming to be from U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE), U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS), or a similar agency. The caller informs the student there's a problem with their visa or immigration status. The scammer might say there's a discrepancy in the student's records, missed paperwork, or even falsely claim they've committed a crime. They threaten the student with deportation or arrest unless a fine is paid immediately, usually through unconventional methods like gift cards or wire transfers. The pressure and fear tactics can make students panic, leading them to comply without verifying the information.</p>

                    <h5>Fake Housing Offers</h5>
            		<p class="ms-3">International students, unfamiliar with local housing processes, are offered rental deals that are too good to be true. Once a deposit or rental fee is paid, the scammer disappears, and the student realizes there's no actual rental property.</p>

                    <h5>Tuition Fee Scams</h5>
            		<p class="ms-3">Scammers pose as university officials and contact students, especially international ones, demanding immediate payment of tuition fees or claiming there's an issue with their payment. The scammer may threaten students with deportation or dismissal from the university unless they pay immediately, usually through a non-traditional payment method like a wire transfer or gift cards.</p>

                    <h5>Phishing Emails Mimicking University Communications</h5>
            		<p class="ms-3">Students receive emails that look like they're from the university's IT department, financial aid office, or another official body. These emails often ask students to click on a link and input personal or financial information, which the scammer then steals.</p>

                    <h5>"Friend-in-Need" Scams</h5>
            		<p class="ms-3">International students are contacted by someone pretending to be a fellow student or a relative back home claiming they're in trouble and need money urgently. Believing the emotional plea, the student sends money, only to find out later it was a scam.</p>

        			<p>Armed with the right knowledge, you can protect yourself and enjoy a smoother academic journey. Here are some practical tips to help you steer clear of scams and keep your information safe:</p>

<ul>
	<li><strong>Verify Before Acting:</strong> Always double-check unsolicited offers or unexpected communications. If an organization like a university department or government agency contacts you, call them back on their official number to verify.</li>
	<li><strong>Don't trust caller ID:</strong> Scammers can spoof numbers to make it look like they're calling from a legitimate organization.</li>
	<li><strong>Research unknown contacts or companies:</strong> If you're unsure about a contact or company, do some online research to see if they're legitimate.</li>
	<li><strong>Guard Personal Information:</strong> Never give out personal or financial information, including passwords or PINs, unless you're certain about who you're dealing with.</li>
	<li><strong>Beware of Pressure Tactics:</strong> Scammers often create a sense of urgency. Take a moment to think and verify before acting, especially if someone is pressuring you to make a quick decision or payment.</li>
	<li><strong>Use Secure Payment Methods:</strong> Only use well-known payment methods or platforms. Avoid wire transfers or gift cards as payments – legitimate entities rarely, if ever, ask for these.</li>
	<li><strong>Research Housing and Job Offers:</strong> Before paying a deposit or accepting a job, research the housing agency or employer. Ask for references and check online reviews.</li>
	<li><strong>Check Email Senders:</strong> Phishing emails often come from addresses that look official but have small differences. Double-check the email address of any suspicious email.</li>
	<li><strong>Update Your Software:</strong> Keep your computer, phone, and other devices updated. Use reputable antivirus and malware protection software.</li>
	<li><strong>Educate Yourself:</strong> Familiarize yourself with common scams, especially those targeting students. Being aware is the first step to protection.</li>
	<li><strong>Trust Your Instincts:</strong> If something feels off or too good to be true, it probably is. It's okay to decline or ask for time to consider.</li>
	<li><strong>Report Suspicious Activity:</strong> If you encounter a potential scam or become a victim, report it to your university and local police. They can provide guidance and alert others.</li>
</ul>

    					</div>
    				</div>	
                    
        			<p>Phone call scams involve fraudsters using deceptive techniques over the phone to manipulate individuals into divulging personal information or sending money. Often disguised as legitimate entities such as banks, tax agencies, or technical support, these scammers exploit fear, urgency, or trust to achieve their malicious objectives, leading to financial losses or identity theft for the unsuspecting victim.</p>
<div class="alert alert-primary" role="alert">
In many cases, callers will use a technique to mask their true caller ID with another government listed phone number or number of a private institution like a bank. If you are unsure about who is calling, tell the individual that you are busy and write down the caller's name and phone number. If the caller refuses, hang up. Government agencies do not request payment over the phone.</div>

                    <h5>Government Impersonators</h5>
            		<p class="ms-3">Scammers pretend to be government officials, such as the IRS or USCIS, and claim that you owe money or there's a problem with your immigration status. They might demand immediate payment, often through unusual methods like gift cards or wire transfers.</p>

                    <h5>Tech Support Scams</h5>
            		<p class="ms-3">Scammers claim to be from tech companies like Microsoft or Apple, warning about a problem with your computer. They might ask for remote access to your device or request payment to fix a non-existent issue.</p>

        			<p>Text message scams involve deceptive messages sent to mobile phones with the intent to mislead recipients into providing personal or financial information. Leveraging tactics such as urgent prompts, fake rewards, or alarming threats, scammers aim to exploit human psychology to gain unauthorized access, commit fraud, or distribute malware. It's crucial to approach unexpected messages with caution and verify their authenticity before taking any action.</p>

                    <h5>Bank Phishing Scams</h5>
            		<p class="ms-3">You might receive a message that appears to be from your bank, saying there's a problem with your account. The message might include a link to a website that looks like your bank's, where you're asked to input your account details. This is a trick to steal your information.</p>

        			<p>Email scams, often called "phishing," are deceptive tactics used by cybercriminals to trick recipients into divulging personal information, such as passwords or credit card numbers. By crafting convincing messages that appear to be from legitimate sources, scammers prey on unsuspecting individuals, leading to financial loss, identity theft, and other serious repercussions. Always exercise caution before clicking on links or sharing personal data online.</p>

                    <h5>Phishing</h5>
            		<p class="ms-3">Similar to the text message bank scams, phishing emails may look like they're from a trusted source. They might ask you to click a link and enter personal information. Always check the sender's email address and never click on suspicious links.</p>

                    <h5>Lottery or Prize Scams</h5>
            		<p class="ms-3">These emails claim you've won a large sum of money or a prize. They'll ask you to pay a fee or provide personal information to claim your winnings.</p>

                    <h5>Employment Scams</h5>
            		<p class="ms-3">These emails offer too-good-to-be-true job opportunities. They might ask you to pay a fee for training or supplies, or request your personal information.</p>

    				</div>	
                    
        			<p>Mail scams are deceptive schemes disseminated via traditional postal mail, intending to defraud recipients. They often present false promises of significant financial gains, solicit personal information, or demand upfront payments, preying on unsuspecting individuals. While the medium has evolved with the advent of email and digital communication, the essence of these scams remains consistent: to exploit trust for illicit gain. It's crucial to approach unsolicited mail with skepticism and verify its legitimacy before taking any action.</p>

                    <h5>Fraudulent Bills or Invoices</h5>
            		<p class="ms-3">Scammers send fake bills or invoices for services you didn't use, hoping you'll pay without realizing it's a scam.</p>

        			<p>It's unfortunate but important to be aware of the scams that can occur when searching for housing, especially as an international student or newcomer. Here are some common scams and ways to avoid them. More information about housing scams can be found on the &lt;REFER-HOUSING>.</p>

                    <h5>Advance Fee Fraud</h5>
            		<p class="ms-3">The scammer asks for a deposit, rent payment, or administrative fee before you've met them or seen the property.  \</p>
		<p class="ms-3"><strong>Prevention:</strong> Never pay money before you see the property and sign a contract. Use secure payment methods, not wire transfers or direct deposit to an unknown account.</p>

                    <h5>Rental Scam</h5>
            		<p class="ms-3">The scammer advertises a property (which may not exist or be already occupied) and tries to collect a deposit or first month's rent. \</p>
		<p class="ms-3"><strong>Prevention:</strong> Always visit the property in person before agreeing to rent. Check that the person showing you the property is indeed the owner or property manager.</p>

                    <h5>Overpayment Scam</h5>
            		<p class="ms-3">The scammer overpays with a check or money order and asks you to wire the difference back. The original payment is fake and will bounce. \</p>
		<p class="ms-3"><strong>Prevention:</strong> Never accept overpayments, and avoid dealing with landlords who propose such schemes.</p>

                    <h5>Identity Theft</h5>
            		<p class="ms-3">The scammer uses the leasing process to get your personal information for identity theft.  \</p>
		<p class="ms-3"><strong>Prevention:</strong> Be careful about the information you provide. Only give your Social Security number and other sensitive personal data when you're sure it's a legitimate lease application.</p>

                    <h5>Sublet Scams</h5>
            		<p class="ms-3">A scammer rents a property so they can show it to you, then sublets it to multiple people and disappears with the deposits and first months' rent. \</p>
		<p class="ms-3"><strong>Prevention:</strong> Ask to see proof of their right to lease the property to you, such as a copy of their lease agreement with their landlord's contact information.</p>

    			<p>Identity theft refers to the deliberate use of someone else's personal information, typically to gain financial benefits or access to resources without permission. As technology has progressed, the ways in which individuals can steal and exploit others' identities have multiplied. This malicious activity can lead to financial losses, damage to one's credit history, and significant emotional distress for the victims. Protecting personal information and being aware of the various tactics used by identity thieves is essential in today's digital age.</p>

    					</div>
    				</div>	
                    
        			<p>Being a student, especially if you're from another country, can sometimes mean you're at higher risk for identity theft. This is because you're often dealing with new systems and processes. Here are some typical ways identity theft might happen to students:</p>

                    <h5>Unsecured Mail</h5>
            		<p class="ms-3">You might receive bank statements, credit card details, or university documents by mail. If your mailbox isn't secure, someone could take these documents and gain access to your personal data. Make sure to empty your mailbox regularly and consider using a mailbox with a lock for added security.</p>

                    <h5>Shared Living Situations</h5>
            		<p class="ms-3">Living with roommates or in dorms, you often leave personal items like bills, ID cards, or passports around. Someone might take a quick photo or make a note of your details. Always keep your personal documents in a safe place, like a locked drawer.</p>

                    <h5>Using Shared Computers</h5>
            		<p class="ms-3">While using computers in libraries or labs, you might log into personal accounts. If you forget to log out, the next user can access your details. Always make sure to log out from personal accounts and avoid accessing sensitive sites on shared computers.</p>

                    <h5>Public Wi-Fi Dangers</h5>
            		<p class="ms-3">When you connect to public Wi-Fi in coffee shops or on campus, your online activities can sometimes be seen by others, especially if the network isn't secure. It's crucial not to access bank accounts or personal data on unsecured networks.</p>

                    <h5>Discarded Documents</h5>
            		<p class="ms-3">Throwing away documents without shredding them first can be an invitation to identity thieves. Items like bank statements, utility bills, or old student IDs have personal data that can be useful for someone trying to steal your identity. Always shred or tear up personal documents before disposing of them.</p>

                    <h5>Oversharing on Social Media</h5>
            		<p class="ms-3">While it's fun to share details about your life, sharing too much personal information, like your birthdate or address, can make it easier for thieves. Always be mindful of what you post and who can see it.</p>

                    <h5>Lost Student ID or Passport</h5>
            		<p class="ms-3">These official IDs have valuable details. If someone gets their hands on your ID, they might try to impersonate you or gain access to certain services or benefits in your name. Report any lost official IDs immediately and take steps to replace them.</p>

        			<p>Identity theft is not a monolithic crime; it manifests in various forms depending on the end goal of the thief.</p>

                    <h5>Financial Identity Theft</h5>
            		<p class="ms-3">By far the most common, this type sees the thief using another person's identity to gain economic benefits. This can manifest in a variety of ways, including unauthorized credit card transactions, new account openings, or even mortgage fraud.</p>

                    <h5>Medical Identity Theft</h5>
            		<p class="ms-3">This involves the unauthorized use of someone else's personal information to obtain medical services. It can lead to incorrect medical records, which can be life-threatening for the victim, and fraudulent billing that can financially burden them.</p>

                    <h5>Criminal Identity Theft</h5>
            		<p class="ms-3">When a criminal presents another person's identity during an arrest or investigation, it results in the real person potentially bearing a wrongful criminal record. This can have long-standing repercussions on the victim's life, including challenges with employment or legal complexities.</p>

        			<p>Being a student can be overwhelming, and amidst all the new experiences and responsibilities, it's crucial to ensure your personal data is safe. A few key habits can significantly reduce your chances of becoming a victim of identity theft.</p>
<div class="alert alert-primary" role="alert">
Awareness is your first line of defense. Always be conscious of where and when you are providing personal information.</div>

<ul>
	<li><strong>Secure Your Mail:</strong> Use a lockable mailbox. Collect mail promptly, and if you're away, ask someone to pick it up or request a mail hold at the post office.</li>
	<li>Safe Online Behavior: Use strong, unique passwords for each online account. Update your computer and phone with the latest security patches. Only use secure Wi-Fi networks, especially when accessing personal or financial sites.</li>
	<li><strong>Document Safety:</strong> Store vital documents like passports, Social Security cards, and bank statements in a secure place, like a lockbox. Shred any documents with personal information before discarding.</li>
	<li><strong>Limit Shared Information:</strong> In shared living situations, keep personal documents out of communal spaces.</li>
	<li><strong>Monitor Accounts:</strong> Check your bank and credit card statements regularly for any unusual activity. Set up account alerts if available.</li>
	<li><strong>Review Credit Reports:</strong> U.S. residents are entitled to a free annual credit report from the major credit bureaus. Review them for any suspicious activity.</li>
	<li><strong>Be Cautious with Social Media:</strong> Limit personal details shared online. Check privacy settings to ensure only trusted friends can see your posts.</li>
	<li><strong>Lost or Stolen IDs:</strong> Report and replace any lost or stolen official IDs immediately. Keep photocopies of important documents in a safe place.</li>

    				</div>	
                    
        			<p>If you suspect or discover that your identity has been compromised, swift action is vital.</p>

                    <h5>Immediate Steps</h5>
            
<ul>
	<li><strong>Contact Your Bank and Credit Card Companies:</strong> Inform them about the potential breach so they can freeze your accounts, preventing unauthorized transactions. They can also guide you on the next steps.</li>
	<li><strong>Change Passwords:</strong> Immediately change passwords for your online accounts, especially for your bank, email, and any other financial or crucial services.</li>
	<li><strong>Report to the Police:</strong> File a report with your local police department. Having an official record can help when disputing fraudulent charges or actions taken in your name.</li>
</ul>
                    <h5>Following Up</h5>
            		<p class="ms-3">Once the immediate threats are addressed, it's essential to safeguard your identity against further threats and rectify any damage done.</p>

<ul>
	<li><strong>Credit Bureaus:</strong> Contact the three major credit bureaus—Experian, TransUnion, and Equifax. Request a fraud alert on your account. This makes it harder for thieves to open more accounts in your name.</li>
	<li><strong>Federal Trade Commission (FTC):</strong> Report the identity theft to the FTC at IdentityTheft.gov. They provide a personalized recovery plan, guiding you through each step.</li>
	<li><strong>Check Your Statements and Credit Reports:</strong> For the next few months, be extra vigilant. Look for any unusual activity in your bank statements and credit reports. If you spot something unfamiliar, report it immediately.</li>
	<li><strong>Seek Legal Counsel:</strong> If you face significant issues, like false criminal charges or extensive financial loss, consider getting legal help.</li>
